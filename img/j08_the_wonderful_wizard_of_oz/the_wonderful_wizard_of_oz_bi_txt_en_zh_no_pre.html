<p class ="en">Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas rairies, with Uncle Henry, who as a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">多萝西住在堪萨斯州的大草原上，与作为农民的亨利叔叔和作为农民妻子的艾姨一起生活。他们的房子很小，因为建造房子的木材需要用马车运到很多地方。有四面墙，一个地板和一个屋顶，这构成了一个房间；这个房间里有一个看起来很生锈的炉子，一个放餐具的柜子，一张桌子，三或四把椅子，还有床。亨利叔叔和艾姆婶婶在一个角落里有一张大床，多萝西在另一个角落里有一张小床。这里根本没有阁楼，也没有地窖--只有一个在地上挖的小洞，叫旋风地窖，万一有大旋风刮起，足以压垮沿途的任何建筑物，一家人就可以去那里。地板中间有一个活板门，从那里有一个梯子通向这个小而黑暗的洞。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.1</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">当多萝西站在门口环顾四周时，除了四面的灰色大草原，她什么也看不到。没有一棵树，也没有一座房子，打破了四面八方伸向天空边缘的广阔平坦的土地。太阳把耕地烤成了灰色的一团，上面有一些小裂缝。甚至连草也不是绿色的，因为太阳已经把长长的草叶顶部烧焦了，直到它们变成了随处可见的相同灰色。房子曾经刷过漆，但太阳把漆泡坏了，雨水又把它冲走了，现在房子和其他东西一样，都是暗淡的灰色。1</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">艾姨来到那里生活时，她是一个年轻漂亮的妻子。阳光和风也改变了她。它们夺走了她眼睛里的光芒，留下了沉郁的灰色；它们夺走了她脸颊和嘴唇上的红色，它们也变成了灰色。她瘦了，憔悴了，而且现在从不笑了。当身为孤儿的多萝西第一次来到她身边时，艾姨被孩子的笑声吓了一跳，以至于每当多萝西欢快的声音传到她的耳朵里时，她都会尖叫着用手按住自己的心脏；她仍然好奇地看着这个小女孩，她能找到任何可以笑的东西。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">亨利叔叔从未笑过。他从早到晚努力工作，不知道什么是快乐。他也是灰色的，从他的长胡子到他的粗糙的靴子，他看起来严厉而庄重，很少说话。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long, silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">是托托让多萝西笑了起来，使她不至于像她周围的人一样变得灰暗。托托不是灰色的，它是一只小黑狗，有着长长的、柔顺的毛发，一双黑色的小眼睛在它滑稽的小鼻子两边欢快地闪烁着。托托整天都在玩耍，多萝西也和它一起玩耍，并深深地爱着它。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">To-day, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the door-step and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">然而，今天，他们没有玩。亨利叔叔坐在门口的台阶上，焦急地看着天空，天空比平时更灰暗了。多萝西抱着托托站在门口，也看了看天空。艾姨正在洗碗。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">从遥远的北方，他们听到了低沉的风声，亨利叔叔和多萝西可以看到长草在即将到来的暴风雨面前呈波浪状弯曲。现在从南方传来一阵尖锐的呼啸声，当他们把目光转向那边时，他们看到草地上的涟漪也来自那个方向。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Toto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap-door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last, and started to follow her aunt. When she was half way across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">托托从多萝西的怀里跳出来，躲在床底下，女孩开始去抓他。艾姆婶婶非常害怕，她推开了地板上的活板门，顺着梯子爬进了那个又小又黑的洞。多萝西终于抓住了托托，并开始跟着她的姨妈。当她走到房间的一半时，风中传来一声巨大的尖叫，房子剧烈摇晃，她失去了脚步，突然坐到了地上。</p></div>

<p class ="en">A strange thing then happened.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">随后发生了一件奇怪的事情。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">房子旋转了两三圈，在空中慢慢上升。多萝西觉得自己好像坐着气球在上升。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">南北风在房子的位置相遇，使它成为旋风的确切中心。在旋风的中间，空气通常是静止的，但是风在房子每一边的巨大压力使它越升越高，直到它处于旋风的最顶端；它留在那里，被带到数英里之外，就像你可以携带一根羽毛一样容易。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">天很黑，风在她身边可怕地呼啸着，但多萝西发现她骑得很轻松。在最初的几次旋转之后，还有一次房子严重倾斜的时候，她觉得自己好像被轻轻地摇晃着，就像摇篮里的婴儿。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">托托并不喜欢这样。他在房间里跑来跑去，一会儿在这里，一会儿在那里，大声地吠叫着；但多萝西却一动不动地坐在地板上，等待着看会发生什么。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">Once Toto got too near the open trap-door, and fell in; and at first the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again; afterward closing the trap-door so that no more accidents could happen.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">有一次，托托离打开的活板门太近了，掉了进去；起初，小女孩以为她失去了他。但很快她就看到他的一只耳朵从洞里伸了出来，因为空气的强大压力使他保持着，所以他不会掉下去。她蹑手蹑脚地走到洞口，抓住托托的耳朵，又把他拖进了房间；然后把活板门关上，以免再发生意外。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">一个小时又一个小时过去了，多萝西慢慢地摆脱了惊吓；但她感到相当孤独，风在她周围大声尖叫，她几乎成了聋子。起初，她想知道当房子再次倒塌时，她是否会被砸成碎片；但随着时间的推移，没有任何可怕的事情发生，她不再担心，决心冷静地等待，看看未来会发生什么。最后，她从摇晃的地板上爬到床上，躺在床上；托托也跟着躺在她身边。</p></div>

<p class ="en">She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose nto her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">她被一股冲击力惊醒，如此突然和严重，如果多多没有躺在柔软的床上，她可能已经受伤了。果不其然，这个罐子让她喘不过气来，不知道发生了什么事；托托把他冰冷的小鼻子凑到她的脸上，沮丧地抱怨着。多萝西坐起来，注意到房子没有动；也不黑，因为明亮的阳光从窗口射进来，淹没了这个小房间。她从床上跳起来，带着托托跟在她后面，跑去开门。</p></div>

<p class ="en">The cyclone had set the house down, very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of green sward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.3</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">旋风把房子吹倒了，对于旋风来说，它非常温和地落在了一个美丽无比的国家中间。到处都是可爱的绿色草地，庄严的树木结着丰硕的果实。每一棵树上都开满了艳丽的花朵，羽毛鲜艳的鸟儿在树上和灌木丛中唱着歌、飞着舞。稍远处有一条小溪，在绿色的河岸之间奔流不息，波光粼粼，对一个长期生活在干燥、灰暗的草原上的小女孩来说，声音非常感激。3</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">当她站在那里热切地看着这些奇怪而美丽的景象时，她注意到有一群她所见过的最古怪的人向她走来。他们不像她一直习惯的那些成年人那样高大；但也不是很矮小。事实上，他们似乎和多萝西一样高，而多萝西在她这个年龄段是个成熟的孩子，尽管从外观上看，他们比她大很多岁。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white,4 and she wore a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders; over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older: her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">三个是男人，一个是女人，都穿着古怪。他们戴着圆圆的帽子，帽子升到离头顶一英尺高的地方，帽檐上挂着小铃铛，随着他们的移动发出甜美的叮当声。男人的帽子是蓝色的；小女人的帽子是白色的。4她穿着一件白色的长袍，在肩上打着辫子；上面撒着小星星，在阳光下像钻石一样闪闪发光。男人们穿着蓝色的衣服，和他们的帽子一样的颜色，穿着擦得很好的靴子，上面有一圈深蓝色。多萝西认为，这些人的年龄和亨利叔叔差不多，因为他们中的两个人留着胡子。但那个小女人无疑要老得多：她的脸上布满了皱纹，头发几乎全白了，而且走路相当僵硬。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice,</p></div>
<div class="top right">

<p class ="en">There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow brick.9 Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow roadbed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweet and Dorothy did not feel nearly as bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">附近有几条路，但她没花多长时间就找到了用黄砖铺成的那条路。9在很短的时间内，她就轻快地走向翡翠城，她的银鞋在坚硬的黄色路基上欢快地叮当响。阳光明媚，鸟儿欢唱，桃乐丝并没有像你想象的那样，一个小女孩突然被从她自己的国家带走，落在一片陌生的土地上，感觉很糟糕。</p></div>

<p class ="en">She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the wicked witch and setting them free from bondage. The Houses of the Munchkins were odd looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">当她走在路上时，她惊讶地看到她周围的乡村是如此美丽。道路两旁有整齐的栅栏，被涂成可爱的蓝色，栅栏外是丰收的谷物和蔬菜田。显而易见，蒙奇金人是个好农民，能够种植大量作物。偶尔她会经过一栋房子，当她经过时，人们会出来看她并低头鞠躬；因为每个人都知道她是消灭邪恶女巫的手段，使他们摆脱了束缚。芒奇金人的房子看起来很奇怪，因为每个房子都是圆形的，有一个大圆顶作为屋顶。所有的房子都被漆成蓝色，因为在这个东方国家，蓝色是最受欢迎的颜色。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Towards evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible and the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.</p></div>

When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down.

<p class ="en">Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on this head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.

<div class ="bottom">

<p class ="en">“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up I too became a wood-chopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.</p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman11 who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"蒙奇金家的一个女孩非常漂亮，我很快就全心全意地爱上了她。她答应我，只要我能赚到足够的钱，为她建一个更好的房子，就嫁给我；于是我开始比以前更努力地工作。但是这个女孩和一个老妇人住在一起11她不想让她嫁给任何人，因为她太懒了，希望女孩留在她身边，做饭和做家务。于是老妇人去找邪恶的东方女巫，并承诺如果她能阻止这桩婚事，就给她两只羊和一头牛。于是，邪恶的女巫给我的斧头施了魔法，有一天，当我正在全力砍伐时，因为我急于尽快得到新房子和我的妻子，斧头一下子滑落，砍断了我的左腿。</p></div>

<div class ="bottom">

<p class ="en">“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tin-smith and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it; but my action angered the wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinner, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinner happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"起初这似乎是一个很大的不幸，因为我知道一个独腿的人不可能做得很好，因为他是一个砍柴人。所以我去找了一个锡匠，让他用锡给我做了一条新腿。这条腿非常好用，一旦我习惯了它；但我的行为激怒了邪恶的东方女巫，因为她曾向老妇人保证我不会娶那个漂亮的蒙奇金女孩。当我再次开始砍伐时，我的斧头滑落，砍断了我的右腿。我又去找制衣匠，他又用锡给我做了一条腿。在这之后，魔法斧头接二连三地砍掉了我的胳膊；但我毫不畏惧，用锡做的胳膊代替了它们。然后，邪恶的女巫使斧头滑落，砍掉了我的头，起初我以为这就是我的结局。但是修理工碰巧来了，他用锡给我做了一个新头。</p></div>

<p class ="en">“I thought I had beaten the wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinner came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"当时我以为我已经打败了邪恶的女巫，我比以前更努力了；但我不知道我的敌人会有多残忍。她想出了一个新的方法来扼杀我对美丽的蒙奇金少女的爱，并使我的斧头再次滑落，以至于它直接切开了我的身体，把我劈成了两半。修理工又一次来帮助我，给我做了一个锡制的身体，用关节把我的锡制手脚和头固定在上面，这样我就可以像以前一样行动自如。但是，唉！我现在没有心了，所以我对蒙奇金姑娘失去了所有的爱，也不在乎是否娶她。我想她还和老太太住在一起，等着我去找她。</p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the hap piest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"我的身体在阳光下闪闪发光，我感到非常自豪，现在即使我的斧头打滑也无所谓了，因为它砍不到我。只有一个危险--我的关节会生锈；但我在我的小屋里放了一个油罐，并注意在我需要时给自己上油。然而，有一天，我忘记了这样做，在一场暴雨中，在我想到危险之前，我的关节已经生锈了，我只能站在树林里，直到你来帮助我。这是一件可怕的事情，但在我站在那里的一年里，我有时间思考，我所知道的最大损失是失去了我的心。在我恋爱的时候，我是世界上最快乐的人；但没有人能够爱上没有心的人，所以我决心要求奥兹给我一颗心。如果他这样做了，我就回去找那个蒙奇奇的少女，并娶她。"</p></div>

<p class ="en">During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.</p></div>

The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely.

<p class ="en">But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts13 and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">于是，樵夫拿起斧头开始砍小树做木筏，当他忙着做这件事的时候，稻草人在河岸上发现了一棵结满精致水果的树。这让整天只吃坚果的多萝西很高兴，她用成熟的水果做了一顿丰盛的晚餐。</p></div>

<p class ="en">But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done. So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">但是做一个木筏需要时间，即使像铁皮人那样勤奋不倦，到了晚上，工作还没有完成。于是他们在树下找到了一个舒适的地方，在那里他们睡得很好，直到天亮；多萝西梦见了翡翠城，梦见了善良的奥兹魔法师，他很快就会把她送回自己的家。</p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land; but the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">可以肯定的是，宽阔的河流现在将他们与这片美丽的土地隔绝开来；但木筏已接近完工，在铁皮人又砍了几根木头并用木销将它们固定在一起后，他们就准备出发了。多萝西在木筏中间坐下，把托托抱在怀里。当胆小的狮子踏上木筏时，木筏严重倾斜，因为他又大又重；但稻草人和铁皮人站在另一端稳住了木筏，他们手里拿着长杆，把木筏推过水面。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft down stream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick; and the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">他们一开始走得很顺利，但当他们走到河中央时，湍急的水流把木筏冲向下游，离黄砖路越来越远；水越来越深，长杆都碰不到水底。</p></div>

<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"如果可以的话，我们一定要去翡翠城，"稻草人继续说，他用力地推着他的长杆，以至于它被河底的泥土紧紧地卡住了，在他再次把它拉出来，或者放手之前，木筏被冲走了，可怜的稻草人被留在河中央紧紧地抓住杆子。</p></div>

</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.</p></div>

<p class ="en">They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.</p></div>

<p class ="en">The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass towards them. It was, indeed, a great, yellow wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field-mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">铁皮人刚要回答，就听到一声低沉的吼叫，他转过头（铰链的作用很好），看到一只奇怪的野兽从草地上向他们奔来。这的确是一只巨大的黄色野猫，木头人认为它一定是在追赶什么东西，因为它的耳朵紧贴着头，嘴巴大张着，露出两排丑陋的牙齿，而它红色的眼睛像火球一样闪闪发光。当它走近时，铁皮人看到在野兽面前奔跑的是一只灰色的小田鼠，虽然他没有心，但他知道野猫试图杀死这样一个漂亮、无害的生物是不对的。</p></div>
</div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.</p></div>

<p class ="en">So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches.

So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.</p></div>

<p class ="en">They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes.

But the Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said,</p></div>

<p class ="en">The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">稻草人和樵夫现在开始用他们带来的绳子把老鼠固定在卡车上。绳子的一端系在每个老鼠的脖子上，另一端系在卡车上。当然，这辆卡车比任何一只要拉它的老鼠都要大一千倍；但是当所有的老鼠都被套上绳子后，他们就能很容易地拉动它。甚至连稻草人和铁皮人也能坐在上面，并被他们奇怪的小马迅速地拉到狮子睡觉的地方。</p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep.</p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en">At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.</p></div>
<div class="top right">

They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were much afraid.

Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy and green pop-corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats and green clothes of all sorts.

There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.

<p class ="en">She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">她让多萝西一个人呆着，又去找其他人。她也把这些人领到了房间里，他们每个人都发现自己住在皇宫里一个非常愉快的地方。当然，这种礼貌在稻草人身上被浪费了；因为当他发现自己独自在房间里时，他愚蠢地站在一个地方，就在门口，等待天亮。躺下也不能让他休息，他也不能闭上眼睛；所以他整晚都在盯着一只在房间一角织网的小蜘蛛，就好像这不是世界上最美妙的房间之一一样。铁皮人因习惯而躺在床上，因为他记得自己是肉做的；但他无法入睡，整夜都在上下移动他的关节，以确保它们保持良好的工作状态。狮子宁愿选择森林里的干树叶床，也不喜欢被关在房间里；但他太理智了，不会因为这个而担心，所以他窜到床上，像猫一样把自己卷起来，一会儿就呼呼大睡。</p></div>

<p class ="en">But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else.

There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and nose and mouth, and was bigger than the head of the biggest giant.</p></div>

There were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.</p></div>

Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given. But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.</p></div>

Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the court-yard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.30</p></div>

It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.</p></div>

All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.</p></div>

One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.</p></div>

But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whomsoever he may be.”</p></div>

The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not. When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o’clock the next morning.34 He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West,35 and he did not wish to meet them again.</p></div>

<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"没错，"奥兹回答。"但还有另一种方法可以使它浮起来，那就是用热空气填充它。热空气不如气体好。40因为如果空气变冷，气球就会在沙漠中掉下来，我们就会迷路。"</p></div>

It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead.</p></div>

There is little or no overt parody in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz—certainly nothing like what one finds in British children’s fantasy of the period—and no vicious satire. On the other hand, Baum’s theosophical interests and his gently dismissive attitude toward conventional religion may be at work here. Rogers points out his “personal interest in nontraditional religion and opposition to the organized churches” of his day (as well as his support of women’s suffrage) is on record in the editorials that he wrote in 1890 and 1891 for the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, in which he advances the claims of Theosophy and at times sounds like a Jeffersonian Deist.

<p class ="en">L. Frank Baum wrote thirteen sequels to the original Oz tale, elaborating on the fantastic inhabitants of that enchanted land. He dedicated the first sequel, The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904), to David C. Montgomery and Fred A. Stone, the actors who played the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow in Baum’s successful musical The Wizard of Oz (discussed below). In The Marvelous Land of Oz, the Scarecrow, whom the Wizard named as his successor at the end of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, enjoys his position as ruler of Oz. (The prominence of the Scarecrow in the 1904 book, which does not feature Dorothy, was most likely the result of his stage counterpart’s great popularity.) Baum seems to have written The Marvelous Land of Oz with an eye toward stage adaptation: Part of the plot involves an army of women—easily imagined as high-kicking chorus girls—who challenge the Scarecrow’s legitimacy. The plot’s entanglements unwind at the hand of Glinda the Good Sorceress, who reveals that the young boy Tip is really Ozma, the rightful ruler of Oz, magically transformed into a boy by the wicked witch Mombi. Though the plot surprise may seem unorthodox, sex changes were familiar in popular theater of the day. Glinda then compels Mombi to restore Ozma to her true form.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">L.弗兰克-鲍姆为最初的奥兹国故事写了13部续集，详细介绍了那片神奇土地上的神奇居民。他将第一部续集《神奇的奥兹国》（1904年）献给了大卫-C-蒙哥马利和弗雷德-A-斯通，他们是在鲍姆的成功音乐剧《绿野仙踪》（下文将讨论）中扮演铁皮人和稻草人的演员。在《神奇的奥兹国》中，稻草人在《神奇的奥兹国》的结尾被巫师指定为他的继承人，享受着他作为奥兹国统治者的地位。(稻草人在1904年的书中的突出地位，并没有多萝西的身影，很可能是由于他的舞台伙伴非常受欢迎的结果）。鲍姆写《神奇的奥兹国》时似乎考虑到了舞台改编的问题。部分情节涉及到一支女性军队--很容易被想象成高踢腿的合唱团女孩--她们挑战稻草人的合法性。情节的纠葛在善良的女巫格林达手中解开，她揭示了小男孩蒂普实际上是奥兹国的合法统治者奥兹玛，被邪恶的女巫蒙比神奇地变成了一个男孩。虽然这个情节的惊喜可能看起来不合常理，但在当时的流行戏剧中，变性是很常见的。格琳达随后强迫蒙比将奥兹玛恢复到她的真实形态。</p></div>

She also appears at the ends of Tik-Tok of Oz, The Scarecrow of Oz, and Rinkitink in Oz. Baum’s imaginative powers shine particularly in The Emerald City of Oz and in the final four novels.

<p class ="en">Inspired by the commercial success of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum quickly adapted his novel for the stage. The 1902 musical comedy The Wizard of Oz, which replaced Toto with Imogene the cow, was a popular success; it opened in Chicago, moved to Broadway, where it played for more than a year, and toured until 1911. A ten-minute silent film version of the play appeared in 1910; it was one of three films based on Baum’s books to appear that year. The other two films were based on a combination of The Marvelous Land of Oz and Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz and the non-Oz story John Dough and the Cherub. Baum also wrote scripts and songs for two other Oz musicals. The Woggle-Bug, Baum’s dramatization of The Marvelous Land of Oz, premiered in Chicago in 1905, soon after the novel’s publication. The play, named after a giant professorial insect who roams Oz, ran for less than a month. It was followed in 1913 by the musical The Tik-Tok Man of Oz, which features Tik-Tok, Betsy Bobbin, and others from the books Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz and The Road to Oz, and plot elements Baum reused in the book Tik-Tok of Oz.</p></div>

<p class ="en">A quarter century later, Oz made a splash on Broadway once again. Based on Gregory Maguire’s best-selling novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995), the musical Wicked opened in 2003 and won three Tony Awards. The intelligent, multilayered novel tells the life story of the Wicked Witch of the West, one of the most notorious villains in literature. Maguire’s story humanizes the witch, whom he names Elphaba, by describing her difficult childhood as the only green-skinned girl at school. Raised by an alcoholic mother and plagued by her room-mate Glinda, a shallow girl interested only in clothes and popularity, the studious Elphaba eventually sets out to overthrow the corrupt Wizard who has overtaken Oz. Wicked has the same ending as Baum’s original tale, but in the retelling Maguire paints a vivid and sympathetic portrait of a well-developed character who is both fiery and appealing.</p></div>

Pursuing his interest in filmmaking, Baum co-produced The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914), which was based on a popular Oz sequel and was made by Baum’s Oz Film Manufacturing Company. The company was also responsible for The Magic Cloak of Oz (1914; released in 1917) and His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz (1914). In 1925 Baum’s son Frank Joslyn Baum co-wrote the screenplay with director Leon Lee for The Wizard of Oz, a film that features Oliver Hardy as the Tin Woodman.</p></div>

<p class ="en">But the release of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz—a work that has in many ways eclipsed Baum’s novel in the cultural consciousness—changed everything. It has been said that more people have seen The Wizard of Oz than any other movie. Its magnificence and impact are even more surprising given the difficulty of producing the film. Nominally directed by Victor Fleming, Wizard required a clutch of directors to save it from disaster. The original director, Richard Thorpe, was fired after twelve days of shooting, and the legendary George Cukor did not last a week. Though Fleming shot the bulk of the picture, King Vidor took over near the end of the process to film the Kansas sequences, including the famous “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” scene, which was nearly cut from the film. Salmon Rushdie, in his seminal study of the film, writes “Who, then, is the auteur of The Wizard of Oz? No single writer can claim that honour, not even the author of the original book.” Indeed, the screenplay was penned by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf, as well as a host of un-credited writers.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">但是，1939年电影《绿野仙踪》的上映--这部作品在许多方面使鲍姆的小说在文化意识中黯然失色，改变了一切。有人说，看过《绿野仙踪》的人比其他任何电影都多。考虑到制作这部电影的难度，它的辉煌和影响甚至更令人惊讶。名义上由维克多-弗莱明（Victor Fleming）执导的《绿野仙踪》需要一批导演来挽救它的灾难。原先的导演理查德-索普在拍摄了12天后就被解雇了，而富有传奇色彩的乔治-库克也没有坚持一个星期。尽管弗莱明拍摄了影片的大部分内容，但国王-维多在拍摄过程接近尾声时接管了堪萨斯州的场景，包括著名的 "彩虹之上 "场景，该场景几乎被从影片中删去。Salmon Rushdie在他关于这部电影的开创性研究中写道："那么，谁是《绿野仙踪》的作者？没有任何一位作家可以宣称有此殊荣，甚至连原书的作者也不行"。事实上，剧本是由诺埃尔-兰利、弗洛伦斯-瑞尔森和埃德加-艾伦-伍尔夫，以及许多未署名的作家共同撰写的。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Serendipitously, however, The Wizard of Oz is near perfect, in part due to sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s star-making turn as Dorothy Gale, the ebullient score, which features “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead,” “Follow the Yellow Brick Road,” and “We’re Off to See the Wizard,” and a wonderfully creative adaptation of Baum’s original ideas. For example, in the film Oz is a dream place to which Dorothy travels while unconscious. The Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion all correlate to farmhands employed by Auntie Em, and the Wizard himself is an alchemized Professor Marvel, whom Dorothy had met on his travels through Kansas. And, in a stroke of cinematic genius, it was decided to shoot the Kansas scenes that frame the film in black and white—actually in a drab, sepia tint—and the Oz sequences in brilliant Technicolor. At the time of the film’s production, nearly all films were still shot in black and white, so this shift to color as Dorothy enters the enchanted realm of Oz would have had an extraordinary impact on audiences.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">然而，偶然的是，《绿野仙踪》近乎完美，部分原因是16岁的朱迪-加兰饰演的多萝西-盖尔成为明星，热情洋溢的配乐，其中包括 "叮咚！女巫死了 "和 "我们去看魔法师"。女巫死了"、"沿着黄砖路 "和 "我们去看巫师 "等热情洋溢的配乐，以及对鲍姆原著的精彩创意改编。例如，在影片中，奥兹国是一个梦境，多萝西在昏迷中前往。铁皮人、稻草人和胆小的狮子都与艾姨雇用的农夫有关，而魔法师本人是一个炼金术的马维尔教授，多萝西在堪萨斯州的旅行中曾遇到他。而且，在电影的天才之作中，决定用黑白色调拍摄堪萨斯州的场景--实际上是用单调的棕褐色色调，而用明亮的技术彩色拍摄奥兹国的情节。在影片制作的时候，几乎所有的电影都还是用黑白拍摄的，所以当多萝西进入奥兹国的魔幻世界时，这种彩色的转变会对观众产生非凡的影响。</p></div>

<p class ="en">It is impossible to conceive of a greater contrast than exists between the children’s books of antiquity that were new publications during the sixteenth century and modern children’s books of which “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” is typical. The crudeness that was characteristic of the old-time publications that were intended for the delectation and amusement of ancestral children would now be enough to cause the modern child to yell with rage and vigor and to instantly reject the offending volume, if not to throw it out of the window. The time when anything was considered good enough for children has long since passed, and the volumes devoted to our youth are based upon the fact that they are the future citizens: that they are the country’s hope, and are thus worthy of the best, not the worst, that art can give. . . . In “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” the fact is clearly recognized that the young as well as their elders love novelty. They are pleased with dashes of color and something new in place of the old, familiar, and winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">在十六世纪新出版的古代儿童读物和现代儿童读物之间，不可能想象出更大的反差，《绿野仙踪》就是其中的典型。古代出版物的特点是粗俗，这些出版物是为了让祖先的孩子们高兴和娱乐，而现在却足以让现代的孩子愤怒地大喊大叫，并立即拒绝这本违规的书，如果不是把它从窗户扔出去的话。任何东西都被认为对儿童足够好的时代早已过去，专门为我们的年轻人编写的书卷是基于这样一个事实，即他们是未来的公民：他们是国家的希望，因此值得得到艺术所能提供的最好而不是最坏的东西。. . .在《神奇的绿野仙踪》中，人们清楚地认识到，年轻人和他们的长辈一样喜欢新奇的东西。他们对色彩的闪烁和新的东西感到高兴，以取代格林和安徒生那些古老的、熟悉的、带翅膀的仙女。</p></div>

<p class ="en">The Wizard of Oz is a film whose driving force is the inadequacy of adults, even of good adults, and how the weakness of grown-ups forces children to take control of their own destinies, and so, ironically, grow up themselves. The journey from Kansas to Oz is a rite of passage from a world in which Dorothy’s parent-substitutes, Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, are powerless to help her save her dog Toto from the marauding Miss Gulch, into a world where the people are her own size, and in which she is never, ever treated as a child but as a heroine.</p></div>
