<p class ="en">When Lyman Frank Baum asked Maud Gage to marry him in 1882, the girl’s mother, a pioneering feminist, fiercely opposed the union. She apparently had good reason: The privileged son of a wealthy oilman, Baum led an itinerant life, uncertain of his future career; at the time, he was acting in a touring theatrical production funded by his father. Maud nevertheless went through with the marriage and found her husband to be a passionate, hardworking dreamer. Like his contemporary Mark Twain, Baum would reach the height of literary success only to have its fruits foiled by ill-timed and often fanciful investments.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">当莱曼-弗兰克-鲍姆在1882年向莫德-盖奇求婚时，这位女孩的母亲，一位女权主义先驱，激烈地反对这种结合。她显然有充分的理由。作为一个富有的石油商的儿子，鲍姆过着流动的生活，对他未来的事业没有把握；当时，他正在演一部由他父亲资助的巡回戏剧作品。尽管如此，莫德还是接受了这段婚姻，并发现她的丈夫是一个充满激情、勤奋工作的梦想家。就像他的同代人马克-吐温一样，鲍姆达到了文学成功的顶峰，但他的成果却被不合时宜的、经常充满幻想的投资所挫败。</p></div>

<p class ="en">If character was destiny for Baum, then early aspirations foretold a future in literature. Born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856, Frank spent his childhood on the Baum family estate, where he was given a printing press and created a family newspaper, the Rose Lawn Home Journal, with his brother. Despite a congenital heart ailment, Baum was quite active as a young man. He began writing professional newspaper articles, plays, poetry, and even a primer on breeding Hamburg chickens in the years following the American Civil War.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">如果说性格是鲍姆的命运，那么早期的愿望则预示着文学的未来。弗兰克1856年出生于纽约的奇特南戈，他的童年是在鲍姆家的庄园里度过的，在那里他得到了一台印刷机，并和他的兄弟一起创办了一份家庭报纸《玫瑰园家庭杂志》。尽管有先天性心脏疾病，鲍姆年轻时还是相当活跃。他开始写专业的报纸文章、戏剧、诗歌，甚至在美国内战后的几年里写了一本关于饲养汉堡鸡的入门书。</p></div>

<p class ="en">When his father and older brother died in 1887, the family’s fortunes declined, and Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen in the Dakota Territory, where Maud’s brothers and sisters were living. Baum started a general store, Baum’s Bazaar, where local children gathered for candy and the imaginative stories Baum told for their entertainment. But their generous extensions of credit to drought-plagued ranchers and farmers forced the couple out of business in 1890. An ill-timed foray into newspaper editing and other publishing ventures left them bankrupt and poised for another move, this time to Chicago. To make ends meet, Frank worked as a reporter and, with good success, as a traveling salesman for the glassware company Pitkin and Brooks.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">1887年，他的父亲和哥哥相继去世，家道中落，鲍姆和妻子搬到了达科他地区的阿伯丁，莫德的兄弟姐妹们也住在那里。鲍姆开了一家杂货店 "鲍姆集市"，当地的孩子们聚集在那里吃糖果，听鲍姆讲富有想象力的故事，以示娱乐。但是，他们向受干旱困扰的牧场主和农民慷慨地提供信贷，迫使这对夫妇在1890年停业。一次不合时宜的报纸编辑和其他出版企业的尝试使他们破产，并准备再次搬家，这次是去芝加哥。为了维持生计，弗兰克当过记者，并在皮特金和布鲁克斯的玻璃器皿公司当过巡回推销员，取得了不错的成绩。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Although Baum’s four sons had long enjoyed their father’s fantastical stories, Baum did not publish his tales until Mother Goose in Prose appeared in 1897. Its success inspired Father Goose, His Book (1899), which was the best-selling children’s book of the year. But it was the story of a farm girl named Dorothy, first told to his sons and neighborhood children in 1898, that became an instant success and would endure as a perpetual classic. Published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900, with illustrations by William Wallace Denslow, Baum’s tale flew out of stores and, when it was staged in 1902, sold out theaters from New York to Chicago.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">尽管鲍姆的四个儿子长期以来一直喜欢他们父亲的幻想故事，但鲍姆直到1897年《鹅妈妈散文集》出版时才发表他的故事。它的成功激发了《鹅妈妈，他的书》（1899年），它是当年最畅销的儿童读物。但是，在1898年首次向他的儿子和邻居的孩子们讲述的一个名叫多萝西的农场女孩的故事，却立即获得了成功，并将作为一个永久的经典而持续下去。1900年以《绿野仙踪》的形式出版，由威廉-华莱士-登斯洛绘制插图，鲍姆的故事从商店里一飞冲天，当它在1902年上演时，从纽约到芝加哥的剧院都销售一空。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Thrilled by the novel’s reception, Baum wrote many sequels to the Oz story and enjoyed considerable financial success. But he also wanted to expand his repertoire beyond stories about Oz. His other books, some published under pen names, include Queen Zixi of Ix (1905), The Fate of a Crown (1905), and the teen series Aunt Jane’s Nieces (1906 through 1915). While these works enjoyed a healthy readership, failed business choices and his audience’s insatiable thirst for more Oz stories, kept him writing sequels until his death.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">鲍姆对这部小说的受欢迎程度感到兴奋，他写了许多奥兹国故事的续集，并取得了相当大的经济成功。但他也想把自己的作品扩展到奥兹国的故事之外。他的其他书籍，有些是用笔名出版的，包括《伊克斯的紫溪女王》（1905年）、《王冠的命运》（1905年）和青少年系列作品《简姨的侄女》（1906年至1915年）。虽然这些作品享有健康的读者群，但失败的商业选择和他的观众对更多奥兹国故事的不满足的渴求，使他一直在写续集，直到他去世。</p></div>

The grounds of his house (named Ozcot) were lush with Baum’s prize-winning flowers, which he cultivated until heart and gallbladder problems seriously threatened his health. Frank Baum died of a heart attack on May 6, 1919.</p></div>

Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else (pp. 13-14).</p></div>

<p class ="en">Frank Baum was not the first to give Americans an American landscape in a children’s book. Twain had done it in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and even more radically in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and Alcott had led out a suite of American pre-teens who grow into young adulthood with the March girls. But Twain and Alcott were writing juvenile books for a more mature audience. This book is Dorothy’s, and Dorothy is a child, in her own words, “a helpless girl” and clearly if indefinably younger than any host of a child’s narrative that Americans had encountered before 1900. We see Dorothy’s world through Dorothy’s eyes, a world constructed and policed, farmed and furnished by adults but modulated by a prose style that is childlike without being childish. In Dorothy, Baum gave America the first truly American child protagonist. 1</p></div>

<p class ="en">Unlike the only two competing contemporary versions of pre teen female protagonists, Lewis Carroll’s Alice and J. M. Barrie’s Wendy (both ten-year-old girls), Baum put Dorothy in a book that features none of the potential cognitive difficulties that still tend to drive children (and some adults) away from the texts of Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. Though he admired Alice in Wonderland (1865), he also found it “rambling and incoherent,” a judgment echoed by subsequent critics, and apparently refused Carroll’s example of a highly internalized and ironic vision of a child’s world.2 The openings alone reveal the vast differences between these visions of childhood:</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">与当代仅有的两个竞争性的十几岁前的女主角版本不同，刘易斯-卡罗尔的爱丽丝和J-M-巴利的温迪（都是十岁的女孩），鲍姆把多萝西放在一本书里，其特点是没有潜在的认知困难，这些困难仍然倾向于驱使儿童（和一些成年人）远离《爱丽丝梦游仙境》和《彼得-潘》的文本。虽然他很欣赏《爱丽丝梦游仙境》（1865年），但他也发现它 "漫无边际，语无伦次"，这一判断得到了后来的评论家的赞同，而且显然拒绝了卡罗尔对儿童世界的高度内化和讽刺性的看法。2仅仅是开篇就揭示了这些童年愿景之间的巨大差异。</p></div>

<p class ="en">There really is no “exterior” here because the author is taking advantage of the potential for exploiting a characteristic of children’s narrative, the tendency to drift between literary and social space. It is all happening “in her own mind”—there are at least three such references in the opening paragraph—and in the syntactic environment, where the reader’s attention is shunted like a Ping-Pong ball through bits of interior monologue (“and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”) and gates of parentheses, which suggest a mind that is capable of reflecting on itself, resulting in the severely hypotactic style we associate with high-octane Victorian satire, while the narrative elides interior and exterior and, by the third paragraph, is in Wonderland.</p></div>

<p class ="en">Baum also understood the central dilemma of any writer entering the genre—that children lend their name to the genre and nothing else—and dedicated himself to creating a thoroughly exteriorized vision of a child who finds herself in trouble. In that consists the decisive difference between Dorothy and her nearest British and European counterparts. Alice’s rabbit hole is not only a corridor to Wonderland but a passage into the unconscious; the result is a serially distorted view of a world she is not all that anxious to get back to as well as a mockery of ordered thought and behavior with no self-enunciating moral or logical center. Scholars love Alice in Wonderland because there is so much space for interpretive intervention; but scholarship, and Freud especially, has no place to stand in Oz and very little to say to Dorothy or about her journey. Oz is a lot of things—colorful, dangerous, silly—but no means as obsessively deranged or as “morally unintelligible” as Wonderland.3 The world of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is optimistic, not sarcastically aloof or, as it so often is in Barrie’s Peter Pan (1904), archly satirical. Wonderland is a psychic, not a physical torment; Neverland is a theme park where the dominant modality is nostalgia. But Oz is a balloon ride away. MGM’s decision to transform Dorothy into a trauma victim and Oz into a mental state blurs the essential difference between these two radically opposed visions of fairy tale and, possibly deliberately, turns Dorothy into an American Alice and a gracefully nuanced American romance into a psychological allegory. Given Hollywood’s obsession with total cinematic disclosure and its prime directive that no fact must ever go unexplained, you get the 1939 film—a work of genius, but not of Baum’s genius.4</p></div>

<p class ="cn">鲍姆也理解任何进入这一类型的作家的核心困境--儿童为这一类型带来了他们的名字，而不是其他，他致力于创造一个彻底外化的、发现自己陷入困境的儿童形象。在这一点上，桃乐丝与她最近的英国和欧洲的同行之间存在着决定性的区别。爱丽丝的兔子洞不仅是通往仙境的走廊，而且是进入无意识的通道；其结果是对一个她并不急于返回的世界的连续扭曲的看法，以及对没有自我声明的道德或逻辑中心的有序思想和行为的嘲弄。学者们喜欢《爱丽丝梦游仙境》，因为那里有很多解释干预的空间；但学术研究，特别是弗洛伊德，在奥兹国没有立足之地，对多萝西或她的旅程也没有什么可说的。奥兹国有很多东西--多彩的、危险的、愚蠢的--但决不是像仙境那样令人痴迷的疯狂或 "道德上不可理解"。3绿野仙踪》的世界是乐观的，而不是讽刺性的冷漠，或者像巴利的《彼得-潘》（1904年）中那样，经常是讽刺性的。仙境是一种精神上的，而不是身体上的折磨；梦幻岛是一个主题公园，其主要模式是怀旧。但奥兹国是一个气球的距离。米高梅决定把多萝西变成一个创伤受害者，把奥兹国变成一个精神状态，模糊了这两个根本对立的童话愿景之间的本质区别，而且可能是故意的，把多萝西变成一个美国的爱丽丝，把一个优雅细致的美国浪漫故事变成一个心理寓言。鉴于好莱坞对电影完全公开的痴迷，以及它的首要指令--没有任何事实可以不被解释，你得到了1939年的电影--一部天才之作，但不是鲍姆的天才之作。4</p></div>

<p class ="en">So for readers who come to the novel after having grown up with the movie, the biggest shock is to find in the novel none of the film’s comforting, gap-filling backstory. Some of the cinematic revisions, such as the snowstorm that wakes the sleepers in the poppy field and that replaces their rescue by the Queen of the Mice in chapter IX, were cost-efficient alternatives to special effects that might have proven impossible or inadequate to the illusion.5 The change from Silver Shoes to Ruby Slippers in the 1939 movie, as most people know, was dictated by technical considerations (red showed up more vividly on the film stock of the period than silver); and American culture would be poorer without some of its memorable dialogue. But the principal changes are in the overall characterization and in retrospect seem less defensible. In the book Uncle Henry and Auntie Em never really emerge from the background and appear together only in chapter I, Auntie Em appearing alone in the very brief closing chapter. The film, however, shows them as loveable (if two-toned) representatives of a loveable Kansas home. Margaret Hamilton’s Wicked Witch turns out to be one more ripple in Dorothy’s concussed subconscious and the Kansas prototype of the Wicked Witch of the West, who even has a name—Almira Gulch. Auntie Em is hardly the “thin and gaunt,” childless old woman whose eyes had lost their sparkle and were as gray as Kansas. She is an all-American original with a tongue and a personality to match. “Almira Gulch,” she says on hearing of Almira’s plan to destroy Toto, “just because you own half the county doesn’t mean you have the power to run the rest of us!” Perhaps the biggest change is in Dorothy herself, who is actually a feistier child in the novel than on film. Consider the witch’s death. The film stages the event as an accident—Dorothy aims a bucket of water at the burning Scarecrow and douses the witch instead. But the novel makes it no accident. The witch tricks Dorothy and obtains one of her Silver Shoes. Dorothy gets “so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch.” Judy Garland’s Dorothy is tearfully apologetic; Baum’s is outspoken and “angry.”6</p></div>

<p class ="cn">因此，对于那些在电影中长大的读者来说，最大的震惊是发现小说中没有电影中令人欣慰、填补空白的背景故事。电影中的一些修改，如暴风雪惊醒了在罂粟地里睡觉的人，并取代了第九章中老鼠女王对他们的营救，是对可能被证明不可能或不足以产生幻觉的特殊效果的成本效益的替代。5大多数人都知道，在1939年的电影中，从银鞋到红宝石拖鞋的变化是由技术上的考虑决定的（红色在当时的电影胶片上显示得比银色更生动）；如果没有其中一些令人难忘的对话，美国文化将变得更加贫穷。但是，主要的变化是在整个人物塑造方面，而且回过头来看，似乎不那么站得住脚。在书中，亨利叔叔和艾姨从未真正从背景中走出来，只在第一章中一起出现，艾姨在非常简短的结尾一章中单独出现。然而，电影却把他们表现为一个可爱的堪萨斯州家庭的可爱（如果是双色）的代表。玛格丽特-汉密尔顿的邪恶女巫原来是多萝西脑震荡的潜意识中的又一个涟漪，是西部邪恶女巫的堪萨斯原型，她甚至有一个名字--阿尔米拉-古奇。艾姨并不是那个 "瘦弱憔悴"、没有孩子的老妇人，她的眼睛已经失去了光彩，像堪萨斯州一样灰暗。她是一个全美国的原创者，有着与之相匹配的舌头和个性。"阿尔米拉-古尔奇，"她在听到阿尔米拉消灭多多的计划时说，"你拥有半个县，并不意味着你有权力管理我们其他人！"也许最大的变化是多萝西本人，她在小说中实际上是一个比电影中更有活力的孩子。考虑到女巫的死亡。电影将这一事件描述为一个意外--多萝西用一桶水对准燃烧的稻草人，结果却浇灭了女巫。但在小说中，这不是意外。女巫欺骗了多萝西并得到了她的一只银鞋。多萝西变得 "非常生气，她拿起站在附近的水桶，把它砸向女巫"。朱迪-加兰笔下的多萝西是含泪道歉的；鲍姆笔下的多萝西则是直言不讳的 "愤怒"。6</p></div>

<p class ="en">The screenwriters (Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf ) also expanded the roles of the three companions and turned the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion into metamor phosed versions of farmhands named Hunk, Hickory, and Zeke. Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan), the genial fraud who watches Dorothy head off as the tornado prepares to descend, reenters her dream vision as the Wizard (as well as, once in the City of Oz, the doorman of the Emerald City, a cabdriver, and the Wizard’s guard). These were more than touches of simple psychological realism. Like the technical stroke to shift to color from black and white when Dorothy arrives in Munchkin Land and the suddenly indispensable musical score, these permanent contributions to the Oz mythology are also improvisations that may not necessarily constitute improvements.7 They blur the clarity of the original, superimposing a second relational network on a clearer original. Dorothy and her companions each lack something and venture to the Emerald City to request it of the Wizard to find it, but in the novel neither the companions nor their deficiencies have reciprocal counterparts in the “real” world of Kansas. Oz is no Purgatory or compensatory educational experience, and it is definitely no metaphor for unconsciousness. Yet the film persuades the audience of a nearly allegorical symmetry between Kansas and Oz and raises unique questions. Is this Dorothy’s way of disclosing in dream truths too dangerous or painful to bear while awake? Are the three companions, like the three beasts who temporarily block Dante’s entrance to Hell, reflections of flaws in her personality? We don’t really know. The movie supplies teasing closures to questions that only it raises. The screenwriters’ brilliant adaptation—whether you find it welcome or not—turns each character into a symbolic referent, a point on a carefully plotted postcyclonic rainbow that begins and ends in Kansas. As a result, the film displaces emphasis from fantasy to psychology and makes several “unforgivable” changes.8 Whatever its justification in commercial or technical terms, the film forces its audience to measure the distance between Kansas and Oz in psychic, not imaginative, terms; it tidies up certain loose ends, such as the origins of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow, each of whose histories is explained in the book, by eliminating the need for explanations. Everything that occurs in the end occurs in Dorothy’s mind.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">编剧（Noel Langley、Florence Ryerson和Edgar Allan Woolf）还扩大了三个同伴的角色，把稻草人、铁皮人和狮子变成了元气大伤的农夫，名叫Hunk、Hickory和Zeke。马维尔教授（弗兰克-摩根），这个和蔼可亲的骗子，在龙卷风准备降临时看着多萝西离开，作为巫师重新出现在她的梦境中（还有，一旦进入奥兹城，翡翠城的门卫、出租车司机和巫师的警卫）。这些都不只是简单的心理现实主义的润色。就像多萝西到达蒙奇金大陆时从黑白转为彩色的技术笔触，以及突然不可或缺的配乐，这些对奥兹国神话的永久贡献也是即兴创作，不一定构成改进。7它们模糊了原作的清晰度，在一个更清晰的原作上叠加了第二个关系网络。多萝西和她的同伴们每个人都缺少一些东西，并冒险到翡翠城向巫师请求找到这些东西，但在小说中，无论是同伴还是他们的缺陷，在堪萨斯的 "真实 "世界中都没有对等的对应物。奥兹国不是炼狱或补偿性的教育经历，也绝对不是对无意识的隐喻。然而，这部电影说服了观众堪萨斯和奥兹国之间近乎寓言式的对称性，并提出了独特的问题。这是桃乐丝在梦中披露真相的方式，在清醒时太危险或太痛苦，无法承受？这三个同伴，就像暂时阻挡但丁进入地狱的三只野兽一样，是否反映了她性格中的缺陷？我们并不真正了解。电影对只有它提出的问题提供了挑逗性的结局。编剧的精彩改编--无论你是否觉得它受欢迎--将每个角色都变成了一个象征性的参照物，是精心策划的后周期彩虹上的一个点，始于堪萨斯，终于堪萨斯。因此，这部电影将重点从幻想转移到了心理学，并做出了一些 "不可原谅 "的改变。8不管它在商业或技术方面的理由是什么，这部电影迫使观众用心理学而不是想象力来衡量堪萨斯和奥兹国之间的距离；它通过消除解释的需要，整理了某些松散的结局，如铁皮人和稻草人的起源，他们的历史在书中都有解释。最后发生的一切都发生在多萝西的头脑中。</p></div>

<p class ="en">This is an essential point: Baum’s Oz, like the Elysian Fields in Greek mythology or the witch’s house in “Hansel and Gretel,” is a place you can get to from here. There is no complicated prospectus, more fit for adults than children, of dream projections of waking originals. The text has a serene confidence in its own imaginative conditions that, along with its disquietingly simple style, are its lasting strengths. For those raised on the movie, what is “missing” is surface complexity, density of characterization, and witty dialogue. Baum’s prose is clear and childlike and represents an uncompromising attention to plot rather than style, to events over character. It’s almost as if children’s literature had found in Baum its own Homer, a writer whose straightforward and occasionally pedestrian style is the determined outcome of the oddness of the story he has to tell. You may miss the character overlays of the film and its calculated verbal ironies, derivative of the more sophisticated children’s books. You may long for the closure you feel when you see Ray Bolger behind the Scarecrow’s outlines or hear the Wizard in Professor Marvel’s voice.9 On the other hand, the novel dispensed with Wonderland-ish exits such as Dorothy’s coming to at the end or the final tableau where the ensemble, including Professor Marvel, gathers around her bed like a Broadway cast taking a second bow. While the last person to consult in matters of intention is the author, it’s noteworthy that Baum’s stated purpose was to “please children of today” with “a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out” (p. 3). Simplicity, in other words, was his goal, not stylistic flash or psychological nuance.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">这是至关重要的一点：鲍姆的奥兹国，就像希腊神话中的极乐世界或《汉塞尔和格雷特》中的女巫之家，是一个你可以从这里到达的地方。这里没有复杂的前景，更适合成人而不是儿童，也没有对清醒的原物进行梦境投射的内容。该文本对自己的想象力状况有一种宁静的自信，加上其令人不安的简单风格，是其持久的优势。对于那些在电影中长大的人来说，"缺少 "的是表面的复杂性、角色的密度和诙谐的对话。鲍姆的散文清晰而富有童趣，代表了对情节而非风格、对事件而非人物的毫不妥协的关注。这几乎就像儿童文学在鲍姆身上找到了自己的荷马一样，一个作家的直截了当和偶尔的迂腐风格是他所要讲述的故事的奇特之处决定的。你可能会怀念电影中的人物叠加和它精心策划的语言讽刺，这是更复杂的儿童书籍的衍生品。你可能会渴望当你看到稻草人的轮廓后面的雷-波尔格或听到马维尔教授的声音中的巫师时，你会感到结束。9另一方面，这部小说省去了仙境式的出口，如多萝西在结尾处的到来，或最后的表态，包括马维尔教授在内的全体成员围着她的床，就像百老汇的演员在做第二次鞠躬。虽然在意图问题上最不应该咨询的是作者，但值得注意的是，鲍姆所说的目的是用 "一个现代化的童话来取悦今天的孩子"，其中保留了奇迹和欢乐，而不包括心痛和恶梦"（第3页）。换句话说，简单性是他的目标，而不是风格上的闪光或心理上的细微差别。</p></div>

<p class ="en">For students of popular literature, one of the least appealing features of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its thirteen sequels may be its flat-affect style and its drifting meanings. Alice in Wonderland has been the subject of dissertations and a Norton Critical Edition.10 Barrie’s Peter Pan, not yet a Norton, was the subject of a famous and still-resonant critical attack; and Barrie, like Carroll/Dodgson, is still a person of intense biographical interest, much of it directed at his suspiciously homoerotic attachment to the Davies boys.11 Andersen and the Brothers Grimm have attracted as many footnotes as readers. By contrast The Wizard of Oz, always clear sailing for children, is the horse latitudes for scholars, with its author’s intentions having drained away into the simple medium of his narrative and its oddities petrified into a system of connections that, as Edith Hamilton remarked of Greek myth, is comprehensive but never coherent. Its very simplicity, in fact, has paradoxically been a barrier to using it in education.12 Yet Dorothy’s book remains nonetheless a book Dorothy herself would likely have been able to read—and probably on her own. Generations of readers struggle with Andersen’s moral inflexibility and his tendency to punish his female protagonists; they find the Grimm’s Fairy Tales as annoyingly elliptical as they find Andersen overwrought; and in both notice a fascination with acts of cruelty and violence. Alice in Wonderland, though not violent, is an intensely linguistic construct of wacky wordplay, allusion, and parody that features but really does not include the child. Wendy, like Alice, is ten, but what ten-year-old will understand what Peter Pan’s obnoxious narrator is alluding to when he compares Captain Hook to “the Sea-Cook”—or Long John Silver of Treasure Island? To get an allusion one must have read as much as the author. The allusive range of any text—whether a children’s book or Eliot’s The Waste Land—is an unspoken measure and reflection of the author’s education and the core curriculum of cultural expectations and values that inform it. More than one reader has asked himself—or his parents—whether protagonists like Alice or Wendy would be able to read the books they are in. Who asks that question about The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?</p></div>

<p class ="cn">对于通俗文学的学生来说，《绿野仙踪》及其13部续集最不吸引人的特点之一可能是其平淡的风格和漂移的意义。爱丽丝梦游仙境》已经成为论文和诺顿批评版的主题。10巴利的《彼得-潘》还没有成为诺顿批评版，却成为了著名的、至今仍有反响的批评攻击的对象；巴利和卡罗尔/道奇森一样，仍然是一个具有强烈传记兴趣的人，其中大部分是针对他对戴维斯男孩的可疑的同性依恋。11安徒生和格林兄弟所吸引的脚注和读者一样多。相比之下，《绿野仙踪》对儿童来说总是一帆风顺，对学者来说则是一马平川，其作者的意图已经流逝在其叙述的简单媒介中，其怪异之处已经石化为一个连接系统，正如伊迪丝-汉密尔顿对希腊神话的评论，它是全面的，但从来没有连贯性。事实上，它的简单性自相矛盾地成为在教育中使用它的一个障碍。12然而，多萝西的书仍然是一本多萝西自己可能会阅读的书，而且可能是自己阅读的。一代又一代的读者对安徒生的道德僵化和他惩罚女主人公的倾向感到挣扎；他们发现格林童话的省略性令人厌烦，就像他们发现安徒生的过度紧张一样；而且在两者中都注意到对残忍和暴力的迷恋。爱丽丝梦游仙境》虽然没有暴力，但它是一个由古怪的文字游戏、影射和模仿组成的强烈的语言结构，其中有儿童，但实际上并不包括儿童。温迪和爱丽丝一样，都是十岁，但哪个十岁的孩子会明白，当彼得-潘的讨厌的叙述者把虎克船长比作 "海炊"--或金银岛的长约翰-希尔维时，他在暗指什么？要理解一个典故，就必须像作者一样读过很多书。任何文本的典故范围--无论是儿童读物还是艾略特的《荒原》--都是对作者所受教育以及文化期望和价值观的核心课程的一种无言的衡量和反映。不止一个读者问过他自己或他的父母，像爱丽丝或温迪这样的主人公是否能够阅读他们所在的书。谁会对《绿野仙踪》提出这个问题？</p></div>

<p class ="en">The difficulty is not always cognitive. The emotional weather in Andersen, Carroll, and Barrie can be dark, wild, and off-putting. Irony is a cognitive threshold for all readers; for children it can be disabling or off-limits. (Try being sarcastic with even the brightest of five-year-olds and he or she may never forgive you.) Irony is a kind of negative exemplification, where you listen to one thing and hear it twice; it is as though the text were singing in harmony with its own implications. Most of life for most children must come with a script, but irony assumes that you already have one; and in fairy tales, which have traditionally been children’s earliest scripted plays, the irony is either structural or nonexistent. But when the Little Mermaid’s grandmother tells her that the only way that she can gain a human soul would be for the prince “to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother,” only those who get the allusion to the marriage ceremony will appreciate the bitter-sweet irony. Tinker Bell’s mantraic response of “silly ass” in response to Peter’s repeated failure to see that her feelings for him are romantic may inspire a ten-year-old’s smile but probably not her recognition. For better or worse, confusion like this never troubles readers of the Oz books, where the prevailing emotional weather is optimistic and the tonalities nearly irony free.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">困难并不总是认知上的。安徒生、卡罗尔和巴利的情感气象可能是黑暗的、狂野的和令人讨厌的。讽刺对于所有的读者来说都是一个认知的门槛；对于儿童来说，它可能是禁用的或不允许的。(即使是最聪明的五岁儿童，也可以尝试讽刺，他或她可能永远不会原谅你）。讽刺是一种消极的例证，你听一件事，却听到两次；就好像文本在与它自己的含义和谐地歌唱。对大多数孩子来说，生活中的大部分内容都必须有一个剧本，但讽刺却假定你已经有了一个剧本；而在童话故事中，传统上是儿童最早的剧本，讽刺要么是结构性的，要么是不存在的。但是，当小美人鱼的祖母告诉她，她能获得人类灵魂的唯一方法是让王子 "如此爱你，以至于你对他来说比他的父亲或母亲更重要 "时，只有那些明白结婚仪式典故的人，才会欣赏这种苦涩的讽刺。小叮当在回应彼得一再看不到她对他的感情是浪漫的时候，口中念念有词地回答 "傻蛋"，这可能会激发一个10岁孩子的微笑，但可能不会让她认识到。不管是好是坏，像这样的困惑从来没有困扰过《奥兹国》的读者，在那里，普遍的情绪天气是乐观的，色调几乎没有讽刺意味。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Nearly, but not completely. Frank Baum, who was crazy about puns, filled the book with soft-pedaled double entendres—which, for many of us, is Irony 101. Removing the Scarecrow’s head in chapter XVI, the Wizard empties the straw and fills the head “with a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many pins and needles,” and then announces, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of bran-new brains” (p. 160). A moment later the Lion says of the pins and needles, “That is proof that he is sharp” (p. 160). Comparing the Tin Woodman to the Scarecrow, Glinda says to the former, “You are really brighter than he is—when you are well polished” (p. 208). Some of Baum’s puns are subtler, but not by much, such as the Tin Woodman’s declaration in chapter XV that he will “bear all [his] unhappiness without a murmur” (p. 155), which is exactly what you would expect of a character with no heartbeat. Other wordplays are contextual: If you were to ask the brainless Scarecrow the question usually posed to fools—“Were you born yesterday?”—he would have to say yes, because, as he relates in chapter III, he actually was born yesterday.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">几乎是，但不完全是。弗兰克-鲍姆对双关语非常着迷，他在书中充满了轻描淡写的双关语--对我们许多人来说，这就是讽刺101。在第十六章中，巫师在取下稻草人的头时，倒掉了稻草，并在头里填上了 "一定量的麦麸，他用大量的针线混在一起"，然后宣布："以后你会成为一个伟大的人，因为我给了你很多麦麸--新的大脑"（第160页）。过了一会儿，狮子说，"这就证明他很聪明"（第160页）。格琳达把铁皮人和稻草人相提并论，对前者说："你真的比他聪明--当你被打磨得很好时"（第208页）。鲍姆的一些双关语更微妙，但也差不了多少，比如铁皮人在第十五章中宣称他将 "毫无怨言地承受所有的不快"（第155页），这正是你对一个没有心跳的人物的期望。其他的文字游戏是有背景的：如果你问无脑的稻草人通常对傻瓜提出的问题--"你是昨天出生的吗？"他将不得不说是的，因为正如他在第三章所说，他实际上是昨天出生的。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Baum’s novel is also a staging area for a form of childproof character irony called the irony of self-betrayal, a dramatic or situational irony that is both childproof and child safe.13 The obvious example is the brainless Scarecrow’s habit of coming up with good ideas. It is he who proposes (in chapter VII, p. 68) the order in which the friends must leap the first chasm, each mounted on the Lion’s back. When the Lion asks, “Who will go first?” the Scarecrow explains his reply—“I will”—in splendidly rational terms: “If you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.” Moments later, after directing the Tin Woodman to chop down a tree in order to make a bridge across the second chasm so they can escape the pursuing Kalidahs, the Lion remarks, “One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw” (p. 70). Immediately afterward, the Scarecrow again figures out how to send the marauding Kalidahs crashing into the gulf (p. 70) and asks the Queen of the field mice to enlist the aid of her subjects in dragging the Lion from the poppy field (p. 87).</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">鲍姆的小说也是一种被称为 "自我背叛的讽刺 "的防止儿童犯罪的人物讽刺的舞台，这种戏剧性的或情景性的讽刺既防止儿童犯罪，又保证儿童安全。13明显的例子是无脑的稻草人习惯于想出好主意。正是他提出（在第七章，第68页）朋友们必须跳过第一个鸿沟的顺序，每个人都骑在狮子的背上。当狮子问道："谁先走？"稻草人用精彩的理性语言解释了他的回答--"我来"。"如果你发现你不能跳过海湾，多萝西就会被杀死，或者铁皮人在下面的岩石上严重凹陷。但是，如果我在你的背上，就不会有这么大的问题，因为掉下去根本不会伤害我。"几分钟后，在指挥铁皮人砍下一棵树，以便在第二道鸿沟上架起一座桥，使他们能够逃脱追捕的Kalidahs后，狮子说："人们几乎怀疑你的脑袋里有脑子，而不是稻草"（第70页）。紧接着，稻草人又想出了如何让掠夺者Kalidahs坠入海湾（第70页），并要求田鼠女王争取她的臣民帮助把狮子从罂粟地里拖出来（第87页）。</p></div>

The fact that the absence of a heart actually produces something more profound—intense regard for everything that moves—is completely lost on the Woodman, just as the Scarecrow is clueless when it comes to knowing the real meaning of having brains. All three companions are alike in assuming a transparent relationship between signs and their meanings—brains, heart, and courage—and this, of course, is the book’s running joke: All three already possess what they go looking for. Sheldon Cashdan has supplied probably the best short description of the novel in noting how it “focuses on perceived shortcoming in the self as opposed to excesses.” 14 The operative word there is perceived.

<p class ="en">The differences between Dorothy and her overseas cousins aside, her story, like Wendy’s and Alice’s, is a version of the heroic quest, from Gilgamesh through Odysseus and Aeneas to Huck Finn, Gully Foyle (the protagonist of Alfred Bester’s science-fiction novel The Stars My Destination), and Luke Skywalker.15 The Wizard of Oz is an odyssey redacted for children and an elaboration of mi croquests like “Hansel and Gretel” and “The Little Mermaid.” Perry Nodelman has described these as “home-away-home” stories, child-sized versions of Northrop Frye’s Monomyth. 16 It is the same story that Western culture has in general outline been telling itself for millennia: Self-knowledge requires physical and emotional self-testing, heroes are often reluctant to answer the call, and at the center of the journey is an encounter with profound truths that connect us with our pasts. In more senses than one, Dorothy’s adventure fits the description, from her accidental landing in Oz to her reluctant acceptance of her power to her recognition, standing in the Wizard’s hall, that not even the lovely Emerald City of Oz can top gray Kansas. Baum’s story is a child’s meditation on Homer’s second great theme, nostalgia, and, like Odysseus, whose name means “born for trouble,” his protagonist has a last name (Gale) that is a subtle predictor of the event, a tornadic windstorm, that determines her destiny.17 Alison Lurie has pointed out how women tend to occupy the dominant roles in all the Oz books, another of its similarities, accidental or not, to Homer’s Odyssey, also dominated by women and traditionally called our great domestic epic.18</p></div>

<p class ="cn">撇开多萝西和她的海外表亲之间的差异，她的故事，就像温迪和爱丽丝的故事一样，是一个版本的英雄追求，从吉尔伽美什到奥德修斯和埃涅阿斯，再到哈克-芬，古利-福尔（阿尔弗雷德-贝斯特的科幻小说《我的目的地》的主人公），以及卢克-天行者。15 绿野仙踪》是为儿童改编的奥德赛，是对《汉塞尔和格莱特》和《小美人鱼》等mi croquests的阐述。佩里-诺德尔曼将这些故事描述为 "离家出走 "的故事，是诺思罗普-弗莱的单口相声的儿童版。 16这是西方文化几千年来对自己讲述的同一个故事：自我认识需要身体和情感上的自我测试，英雄们往往不愿意响应这个号召，而在旅程的中心是与连接我们和我们的过去的深刻真理的相遇。在更多的意义上，多萝西的冒险符合这种描述，从她意外地降落在奥兹国，到她不情愿地接受她的力量，再到她站在巫师的大厅里认识到，即使是可爱的奥兹国翡翠城也不能超越灰色的堪萨斯。鲍姆的故事是儿童对荷马第二大主题--怀旧--的沉思，而且，像奥德修斯一样，他的名字意味着 "为麻烦而生"，他的主人公有一个姓氏（盖尔），是对决定她命运的事件--一场龙卷风的微妙预测。17艾莉森-卢里指出，在所有奥兹国的书中，女性往往占据主导地位，这是它与荷马的《奥德赛》的另一个相似之处，不管是不是偶然的，后者也是由女性主导的，传统上被称为我们伟大的家庭史诗。18</p></div>

<p class ="en">While the imaginative world of Oz bears a family resemblance to whole libraries of fantasy and adventure, it is hard to identify Baum’s principal influences. He so artfully sublimates his sources they seem sui generis, reminders of Eliot’s remark that bad writers borrow and good writers steal. Some, like the kind Stork, are elements that appear in all children’s literature, which features lots of talking animals—the noteworthy exception being Toto, who exemplifies that conundrum of children’s literature, the Goofy/Pluto Quandary—that is, why some animals speak and others do not, why Goofy has full command of the language and Pluto, Mickey’s dog, can only bark.19 Some elements of suggestive iconographic value, such as the Wicked Witch’s dread of water or the fact that her blood has all dried up, seem easily parsed. Others are less certain. The mark on Dorothy’s forehead left by the Good Witch of the North is talismanic, like Achilles’ unprotected heel or the more contemporary inheritor of the same idea, the lightning-bolt scar on Harry Potter’s brow. Does it also point to the mark made by offended deity to protect Cain from harm and to perpetuate his torment? When Odysseus visits Hell in book 11 of the Odyssey, the reason is to get directions home from Tiresias, and, similarly, Dorothy undertakes the trip to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard how to get back to Kansas. Yet Oz is no more Hades than Hades Oz. The bar of iron that the Witch places in the middle of her kitchen floor to trip up Dorothy half works—Dorothy trips and loses one of her Silver Shoes—but also inverts tradition: Bar iron is usually associated with warding off demons, not innocent little girls. The witch has a single cyclopean eye that announces a disturbing union of monstrosity and omniscience (and to some may point to Freemasonry’s single eye that appears on U.S. currency). In Greek myth, Hermes wears a cap of wings, and in Baum’s Oz Dorothy has a Golden Cap. The Winged Monkeys seem related to neutral instrumentalities of evil authority like the Harpies or Wagner’s Valkyrie, but neither of these antecedents is as reasonable or eloquent as Baum’s equivalents. 20 The apportionment of real estate in Oz is impressive, with the witches governing regions designated by the four cardinal points. But why did Baum assign positive moral values to north and south and negative to east and west—a literary fact, or accident, that Littlefield would use sixty-four years later when he advanced his famous reading of the book as a political allegory?21</p></div>

<p class ="cn">虽然奥兹国的想象力世界与整个幻想和冒险图书馆有很多相似之处，但很难确定鲍姆的主要影响。他如此巧妙地升华了他的来源，使它们看起来自成一体，让人想起艾略特的一句话：坏作家是借的，好作家是偷的。有些元素，如善良的鹳鸟，出现在所有的儿童文学作品中，其中有很多会说话的动物--值得注意的例外是托托，他体现了儿童文学的难题，即高飞/普鲁托之问--也就是说，为什么有些动物会说话，有些则不会，为什么高飞能完全掌握语言，而米奇的狗普鲁托却只会吠叫。19一些具有暗示性的图标价值的元素，如邪恶女巫对水的恐惧或她的血液已经全部干涸的事实，似乎很容易被解析。其他则不太确定。北方好女巫在多萝西额头上留下的印记是护身符，就像阿基里斯没有保护好的脚跟，或者是同一概念的更现代的继承者，哈利-波特眉心的闪电疤痕。它是否也指向被冒犯的神明为保护该隐不受伤害而做的标记，并使他的苦难延续下去？当奥德修斯在《奥德赛》第11卷中访问地狱时，原因是想从提瑞西阿斯那里得到回家的方向，同样地，多萝西进行翡翠城之行是为了询问巫师如何回到堪萨斯州。然而，奥兹国并不比哈迪斯奥兹国更像哈迪斯。女巫为了绊倒多萝西而在厨房地板中间放置的铁条有一半的作用--多萝西被绊倒，失去了她的一只银鞋，但也颠覆了传统。铁条通常与驱赶恶魔有关，而不是无辜的小女孩。女巫有一只单眼皮的眼睛，宣布了一个令人不安的畸形和全知的结合（对一些人来说，可能是指共济会的单眼皮，出现在美国货币上）。在希腊神话中，赫尔墨斯戴着一顶翅膀的帽子，而在鲍姆的《奥兹国》中，多萝西有一顶金帽。带翅膀的猴子似乎与哈皮斯或瓦格纳的女武神等邪恶权威的中性工具有关，但这些前身都不像鲍姆的对应物那样合理或雄辩。 20奥兹国的房地产分配令人印象深刻，女巫们管理着由四个基本点指定的区域。但是，为什么鲍姆把积极的道德价值分配给北方和南方，而把消极的道德价值分配给东方和西方--这是一个文学事实，或者说是一个意外，利特尔菲尔德在64年后把这本书作为一个政治寓言进行了著名的解读。21</p></div>

<p class ="en">Or, again, take those Silver Shoes. They seem to reach back to the Cinderella story but in a not entirely helpful way. Dorothy is not Cinderella—and not only because she is of less than marrying age. Dorothy’s home life is comfortable and happy; moreover, all Cinderellas, male or female, are sponsored by some natural agency that functions as a parent surrogate—a fairy godmother, a Mother Holle, the spectral grandmother of the Little Match Girl, or in derivatives like Flashdance or Rocky, as the protagonist’s aging female dance instructor or his grouchy fight trainer. Every Cinderella is special in the first place, a member of a natural aristocracy who has gone unrecognized by dog-and-cat humanity until Nature intervenes and teaches the world to see beauty with Nature’s eyes. This is children’s literature’s own law of natural selection, which states that no naturally gifted child must ever be forced to suffer for very long either social exploitation, social invisibility, or familial mar ginality. The Cinderella scenario hardly applies to Dorothy, who is special only after she is picked up and set down in Oz. She has a happy home, is only technically “homeless” while in Oz, and has two adoptive parents who love her. She is, moreover, a typical little girl from Kansas whose most precious gift is that she knows it. Her confinement in the castle of the Wicked Witch seems an analogue to Cinderella’s situation, but Dorothy does little work and spends part of her time in bitter tears. Each invocation of possible precedent only introduces more alienating distance. Scattered throughout the novel there are many such symbols that seem interpretive dead ends—the fact that white is the witch color, for instance, which inverts the anticipated hierarchy of color-coded values, or that, as we learn in chapter XII, the witch is afraid of the dark. The same is true of so many story elements that their appearances, rather than being iterations of some ancient property of fantastic literature, are really opportunities for Baum to empty them and then fill them with his own American content. Whence the continuing and probably endless parade of allegorical readings of the novel, from Henry Littlefield’s to Herblock’s famous 1939 cartoon, in which Hitler is cast as the Wicked Witch of the West and Mussolini one of the Flying Monkeys. Baum approached his sources like someone on a shopping spree rather than one conducting a calculated raid.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">或者，再拿那些银色鞋子来说。它们似乎回到了灰姑娘的故事，但不是完全有用的方式。多萝西不是灰姑娘--不仅仅是因为她还不到结婚的年龄。多萝西的家庭生活是舒适和幸福的；此外，所有的灰姑娘，不管是男性还是女性，都是由一些自然机构赞助的，这些机构作为父母的代理人发挥作用--仙女教母、Holle母亲、小火柴人的幽灵祖母，或者在《闪电舞》或《洛基》等衍生品中，作为主人公年迈的女舞蹈教练或他脾气古怪的拳击教练。每一个灰姑娘首先都是特别的，是一个自然贵族的成员，他们没有被狗和猫的人类所承认，直到大自然的介入，教世界用大自然的眼睛看美。这是儿童文学自己的自然选择法则，它指出，没有一个天生的天才儿童必须被迫长期忍受社会剥削、社会隐蔽性或家庭婚姻的影响。灰姑娘的情景几乎不适用于桃乐丝，她只是在被捡到并被安置在奥兹国之后才变得特别。她有一个幸福的家，只是在奥兹国时技术上 "无家可归"，并且有两个爱她的养父母。此外，她是一个来自堪萨斯州的典型的小女孩，她最珍贵的礼物是她知道。她被关在邪恶女巫的城堡里，似乎与灰姑娘的情况类似，但多萝西几乎没有做什么工作，她的部分时间是在痛苦的泪水中度过的。每一次对可能的先例的援引都只会引入更多的疏远。小说中散布着许多这样的符号，它们似乎是解释的死胡同--例如，白色是女巫的颜色，这颠覆了预期的颜色编码的价值等级，或者，正如我们在第十二章中所了解的，女巫害怕黑暗。许多故事元素也是如此，它们的出现，与其说是梦幻文学的一些古老特性的迭代，不如说是鲍姆清空它们，然后用他自己的美国内容来填充它们的机会。因此，从亨利-利特尔菲尔德到赫布克1939年的著名漫画，对这部小说的寓言式解读持续不断，而且可能无穷无尽，在这些漫画中，希特勒被当作西方的邪恶女巫，墨索里尼是飞猴之一。鲍姆接近他的资料来源时，就像一个正在购物的人，而不是一个正在进行精心策划的袭击的人。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Perhaps this whimsicality also explains why certain apparently pregnant details lead nowhere, such as the man in the small house Dorothy and her companions stop at on the way to the Emerald City, who “had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner” (pp. 94-95), the “seven passages and three flights of steps” (pp.104-105) through which Dorothy is led on the way to her room in the Palace, or the fact that the Wizard charges them to come to his Throne Room “at four minutes after nine o’clock” in the morning (p. 148). Was Baum preparing some role for the character with the bad leg that he either forgot about or failed to find a place for? Was one of his children, perhaps, born at 9:04 A.M.? Or are these details simply forgivable inconsistencies, like the behavior of the Tin Woodman, who is moved to tears when he accidentally steps on a bug yet slays a wildcat and forty wolves, or that Dorothy is suddenly found to be wearing a whistle “that she had always carried about her neck since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her” (p. 140), when, in fact, this never happened?</p></div>

<p class ="cn">也许这种异想天开也解释了为什么某些明显的细节会无疾而终，比如多萝西和她的同伴在去翡翠城的路上停在小房子里的那个人，"他的腿受伤了，躺在角落的沙发上"（第94-95页），"七个通道和三层台阶"（第104-105页或魔法师要求他们在早上 "九点过四分 "到他的宝座室来（第148页）。鲍姆是否在为这个腿脚不灵便的人物准备某种角色，而他要么忘记了，要么没能找到合适的位置？也许他的一个孩子是在上午9点04分出生的？或者这些细节只是可以原谅的不一致之处，比如铁皮人的行为，当他不小心踩到一只虫子时被感动得哭了，但他却杀死了一只野猫和40只狼，或者突然发现多萝西带着一个哨子，"自从老鼠女王给她的时候，她一直带在脖子上"（第140页），而事实上，这从未发生。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Baum’s use of colors is particularly intriguing. There were initially four witches, and by the end of chapter III only one bad one, the Witch of the West, is left. (Should we make anything of the fact that by her very arrival in Oz Dorothy instantly tips the balance in favor of the good and dresses in a frock of white, the witch color, and blue?) Green, the color of the Emerald City, has a persistently ambiguous value in literature, a two-headed semantic arrow that points in opposite or divergent directions. While it gestures to nature and to the appealing presence of natural forces, like nature itself it can possess a malign, counter-Wordsworthian aspect. In Gawain and the Green Knight, for instance, green is assigned to a figure who mingles both beauty and monstrosity, virtue and cruelty; in The Great Gatsby, green is the color of the inspirational light at the end of Daisy Buchanan’s dock and of the “death car” that kills Myrtle Wilson. But what does Baum’s selection of green represent?22 The same is true of blue, the Munchkin’s “favorite” color and the one “most frequently seen,” according to Biedermann, “as a symbol for things of the spirit and the intellect”—from the Virgin Mary’s mantle in stained glass windows to Veronica Sawyer’s outfits in Michael Lehmann’s Heathers (1989).23 Does Dorothy’s progression from a blue-dominated land to a “green” destination make some significant commentary on her journey, or is the relationship an accidental correlation? Leading the inexplicables is the name Oz itself.24 Baum, who as Hearn says was not the most careful writer, clearly had fun with his material—extemporizing from sources that may in the long run have been purely and hopelessly autobio graphical.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">鲍姆对颜色的使用特别耐人寻味。最初有四个女巫，到第三章结束时，只剩下一个坏女巫，即西边的女巫。(多萝西一到奥兹国就立即使天平向好的方面倾斜，并穿上了白色（女巫的颜色）和蓝色的连衣裙，我们应该对这一事实有所了解吗？绿色，翡翠城的颜色，在文学中一直有着模糊的价值，是一个双头的语义箭头，指向相反或不同的方向。虽然它象征着自然和自然力量的诱人存在，但就像自然本身一样，它可以拥有一个恶毒的、反沃兹沃斯的一面。例如，在《高文与绿骑士》中，绿色被赋予了一个将美丽与畸形、美德与残酷混为一体的人物；在《了不起的盖茨比》中，绿色是黛西-布坎南码头尽头的灵感之光的颜色，也是杀害默特尔-威尔逊的 "死亡之车 "的颜色。但是鲍姆选择的绿色代表什么呢？22蓝色也是如此，蒙奇金 "最喜欢 "的颜色，也是 "最经常看到的"，根据Biedermann的说法，"作为精神和智力事物的象征"--从彩色玻璃窗中的圣母玛利亚的衣钵到Michael Lehmann的Heathers（1989）中Veronica Sawyer的服装。23多萝西从一个蓝色为主的土地到一个 "绿色 "的目的地的进展是否对她的旅程做出了一些重要的评论，或者这种关系是一种偶然的关联？导致无法解释的是奥兹国这个名字本身。24鲍姆，正如赫恩所说，不是最谨慎的作家，显然对他的材料很感兴趣--从长远来看，可能是纯粹的、无望的自传图画的来源进行了改编。</p></div>

<p class ="en">In Oz, and nearly everywhere in fantasy, this is the prime directive: Good is inevitably stronger than evil. It informs Dorothy’s appeal to the Wizard and, prior to that, the behavior of the Stork, and it is one more reason, arguably the principal one, for the discomfort experienced by the first generation of fans of the book who were faced with a troubling ambiguity. Oz is a place where good dominates, but where you will also find that impossible contradiction, the good witch. This is by all evidence Frank Baum’s invention and arguably his lasting contribution to the representational vocabulary of Western literature. Nowhere do you find a good witch before Baum, who combines a traditional occult figure with the American progressive’s optimistic faith in human nature—what is nowadays termed, often disparagingly, secular humanism—and invents a whole new moral typology. The righteous who may be tempted to read J. K. Rowling understand the dilemma intimately. What good is it if the message is consonant with Christian morality but the vehicle is not? In the long run, Baum’s entrepreneurial approach to tradition echoed Whitman’s cry of “creeds and schools in abeyance”; like Whitman, Baum wanted to give America something completely new—the concept of “neutral magic,” of the occult as something rationally available and subject to domestication without the help of traditionally “demonic” assistants. The outcome is everywhere around us, in films especially, from the Force in Star Wars to Practical Magic. Baum’s morality is rooted in humanistic ideals and only incidentally in scriptural principles.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">在奥兹国，以及几乎所有的幻想中，这都是首要的指令。善不可避免地比恶更强大。它影响了多萝西对魔法师的呼吁，在那之前，也影响了鹳的行为，而且它是第一代书迷所经历的不适的另一个原因，可以说是主要原因，因为他们面临着一个令人不安的模糊性。奥兹国是一个善良占主导地位的地方，但你也会在那里找到那个不可能的矛盾体，即好女巫。从所有证据来看，这是弗兰克-鲍姆的发明，也可以说是他对西方文学的代表性词汇的持久贡献。在鲍姆之前，你在任何地方都找不到好女巫，他将传统的神秘主义人物与美国进步人士对人性的乐观信念--即现在经常被贬低的世俗人文主义--结合起来，发明了一种全新的道德类型。那些可能被诱惑去读J.K.罗琳的正直人士非常了解这种困境。如果信息符合基督教道德，但载体不符合，那有什么用呢？从长远来看，鲍姆对传统的创业方式呼应了惠特曼 "信条和学校都被搁置 "的呼声；像惠特曼一样，鲍姆想给美国带来一些全新的东西--"中性魔法 "的概念，将神秘学作为合理的东西，在没有传统的 "恶魔 "助手的帮助下进行驯化。其结果在我们周围随处可见，特别是在电影中，从《星球大战》中的原力到实用魔法。鲍姆的道德观植根于人文主义理想，只是顺带一提的是圣经原则。</p></div>

<p class ="en">This exchange has essential premonitory value. Many in the audience who believed as Dorothy did (“all witches [are] wicked”) might have objected to the whole concept of a Good Witch, one certainly without scriptural or moral precedent. The only witches who appear in the Bible came to their power through satanic influence; prior to that the only appeal is to Greek myth’s two isolated examples, Circe and Medea, either of whom occupy a different register since, technically, neither had any traffic with the infernal. As for fairy tales, which by then had been circulating at least since Grimms’ tales appeared in English in 1826, they feature neither “good” witches nor exemplary human practitioners of the black arts.25 Yet Baum gives his audience a strange, tricky place to stand in Dorothy’s narrative by having Dorothy ask their question and receive an answer that, couched in the suggestion that Kansas is a synechdoche for civilization, must have struck an ambivalent chord. His essential imaginative discovery was that to be a witch did not mean you belonged to some dark aristocracy of the spirit because magic was an instrumentality like electricity, magnetism, or fire.26 In this new republic of the imagination, a person could become a president, a wizard, a person with brains, or a witch.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">这一交流具有重要的预示价值。许多和桃乐丝一样相信（"所有的女巫都是邪恶的"）的观众可能会反对整个好女巫的概念，这个概念肯定没有圣经或道德先例。唯一出现在《圣经》中的女巫是通过撒旦的影响而获得权力的；在此之前，唯一的诉求是希腊神话中的两个孤立的例子，Circe和Medea，她们都占据了不同的位置，因为从技术上讲，她们都没有与地狱有任何联系。至于童话，至少在1826年格林姆斯的故事以英语出版后就一直在流传，它们既没有 "好 "女巫，也没有黑魔法的模范人类实践者。25然而，鲍姆在多萝西的叙述中给了他的观众一个奇怪的、棘手的位置，让多萝西问他们的问题，并得到一个答案，这个答案在堪萨斯是文明的象征的暗示下，一定会引起一种矛盾的共鸣。他的基本想象力发现是，成为女巫并不意味着你属于某种黑暗的精神贵族，因为魔法是一种像电、磁或火一样的工具。26在这个新的想象力共和国中，一个人可以成为总统、巫师、有头脑的人或女巫。</p></div>

<p class ="en">In the longest run, Baum’s book is remarkable for its Emerson ian attitude toward science, the future, and technology. Everywhere you look in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz you find gadgets or inventions that seem to reflect the adventurousness of its author’s imagination. The Wizard of Oz, hardly a bad man after all (and certainly no wizard), is originally from Omaha and arrives (and departs) by balloon. His transformation of Oz into the Emerald City, a green utopia, is accomplished mostly by salesmanship—he distributes among the population green spectacles—and thereby joins that distinguished cast of commercial foot soldiers in American literature, from Stephen Crane’s drummer in “The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky” through Dreiser’s Hurstwood (in Sister Carrie), Fitzgerald’s Nick Carraway all the way up (or down) to Willy Loman. The Wizard of Oz produces “wonders” by means of technical daring or simple chicanery, a stark contrast to the victories of the witches, both good and bad, who surround (and fear) him; the Emerald City of Oz is the elision of convention and novelty, of the typical magical props of fantasy with nuts-and-bolts American technology. The magical Silver Shoes coexist with the Wizard’s balloon, the balloon with the Wicked Witch, the tinkers and the tinsmiths with the Winged Monkeys and that oddest of Oz’s brain belches, the dainty china people. The title of chapter XVI, “The Magic Art of the Great Humbug,” effectively summarizes what Baum is up to: forging an alliance between the human and the occult, the latter being owned by the former. Under no compulsion to separate the fantastic from the science fiction element, he ignores the self-consciously generic distinction, still enforced on newsstands where you can find Analog side by side with The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, between the magical and the manufactured. With Oz he designed an alternative Wonderland—American, external, and accessible.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">从长远来看，鲍姆的书因其对科学、未来和技术的爱默生式态度而引人注目。在《绿野仙踪》中，你在任何地方都能找到一些小玩意或发明，似乎反映了作者的想象力的冒险性。奥兹国的巫师，毕竟不是一个坏人（当然也不是巫师），他最初来自奥马哈，乘坐气球到达（和离开）。他把奥兹国变成了翡翠城，一个绿色的乌托邦，主要是通过销售技巧完成的，他在人们中间分发绿色的眼镜，从而加入了美国文学中杰出的商业步兵阵容，从《新娘来到黄天》中斯蒂芬-克兰的鼓手到德莱塞的赫斯特伍德（《嘉莉妹妹》），菲茨杰拉德的尼克-卡拉威一直到威利-洛曼。奥兹国的巫师通过技术上的大胆或简单的诡计创造了 "奇迹"，这与围绕在他身边（和害怕）的好的和坏的女巫的胜利形成了鲜明的对比；奥兹国的翡翠城是传统和新奇的结合，是典型的幻想的魔法道具与美国的螺母和螺栓技术的结合。神奇的银鞋与巫师的气球共存，气球与邪恶的女巫共存，工匠和锡匠与翼猴以及奥兹国最古怪的脑瓜子，娇小的瓷人共存。第十六章的标题是 "伟大的洪堡人的魔法艺术"，有效地概括了鲍姆的目的：在人类和神秘学之间建立联盟，后者为前者所拥有。在没有强制要求将奇幻与科幻元素分开的情况下，他忽略了自觉的通用区别，在报摊上，你可以看到《模拟》与《幻想与科幻》杂志并排在一起，神奇与制造之间的区别仍然被强制执行。他用《奥兹国》设计了一个另类的仙境--美国的、外部的、可接触的。</p></div>

<p class ="en">And a wizard, lest we forget, whose success—to the extent we credit it as such—is the result not of black magic but benign chicanery and fairground illusion. It’s always amazed me how we tend to overlook the fact that the title is as ironic as The Great Gatsby. Baum’s Wizard is to the traditional sorcerer what Yossarian is to the hero—a comic, and therefore unconventional representative of a class of characters whom we rarely, if ever, laugh at when we see them. He is an antiwizard, a disarmingly likable fraud who has everybody in town wearing green spectacles and who builds a balloon, that last word in air travel in Baum’s day, but forgets to rig it with controls—his balloon will only descend, it appears, when the hot air cools. The point is not that Frank Baum considered all wizards frauds—which would be equivalent to suggesting that he had made up his mind about the nature of all fantasy—but that he could imagine a fraud who might, given the right opportunity, turn out to be a pretty good wizard. Moral categories in Oz are identified by how you use what you have and not by your innate character traits—which once upon a time was what America stood for. Oz, in other words, is no aristocracy but a magical democracy. You can be anything you want—wizard or witch—without worrying that your choices are front-loaded by a particular set of values. For some, the appeal of fantasies like Andersen’s and Grimms’, continuing through Carroll and directly into Rowling, is a lingering nostalgia for an aristocracy of moral personality, where distinctions are innate and a person is born, as Blake said, “a garden ready and planted.” Into those fantasies enter characters who bridge the gaps and introduce welcome elements of ambiguity. Even Harry Potter, that ide alization of the adolescent consumer, has an elite pedigree that separates him from the Mudbloods. But Dorothy is hardly an aristocrat, and the Oz she enters is ambiguous from the beginning, a triumph of coexistent and codependent moral and imaginative technologies. One is the ancient one of fairy tale and fantastic literature, of wicked witches with nonaligned helpers, natural agents that serve as liminal figures, talking animals and enchanted footwear. The other is Baum’s, whose sublimest invention is this place where the extraordinary and the everyday live side by side and mirror each other. When the good witch says that Oz is “more powerful” than any of the other witches in Oz, she is preparing the reader for the book’s gentlest but most engaging irony. “How can I help being a humbug,” he says after he is exposed, “when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can’t be done?” (pp. 162-163). But, of course, they don’t know. The Wizard of Oz’s power is ultimately dependent on the gullibility of his audience and his sense of supply and demand. At bottom he may not be much of a wizard, as he himself admits. But he is still a pretty good American salesman. And in Oz, salesmanship—that improbably American contribution to Western cultural values—is stronger than sorcery.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">还有一个巫师，以免我们忘记，他的成功--在我们认为是成功的程度上--不是黑魔法的结果，而是良性的骗局和游乐场的幻觉。我一直很惊讶，我们怎么会忽视这个标题和《了不起的盖茨比》一样具有讽刺意味的事实。鲍姆的巫师对于传统的巫师来说，就像约萨里安对于英雄一样，是一个滑稽的，因此也是一类人物的非常规代表，当我们看到他们时，我们很少，甚至从来没有嘲笑过他们。他是一个反巫师，是一个令人讨厌的骗子，他让镇上的每个人都戴上了绿色的眼镜，他造了一个气球，在鲍姆的时代是空中旅行的最后一个词，但他忘了给它装上控制装置--他的气球似乎只有在热空气冷却后才会下降。重点不是弗兰克-鲍姆认为所有的巫师都是骗子--这相当于暗示他已经对所有幻想的性质下定了决心--而是他可以想象一个骗子，如果有合适的机会，可能会变成一个相当好的巫师。奥兹国的道德类别是由你如何使用你所拥有的东西来确定的，而不是由你天生的性格特征来确定的--这曾是美国所代表的。换句话说，奥兹国不是贵族制度，而是一种神奇的民主。你可以成为你想要的任何东西--巫师或女巫--而不必担心你的选择是由一套特定的价值观来决定的。对一些人来说，像安徒生和格林姆斯的幻想的吸引力，通过卡罗尔并直接进入罗琳，是对道德人格贵族制的一种挥之不去的怀念，在那里，区别是与生俱来的，一个人出生时，正如布莱克所说，"一个准备好的花园和种植的"。在这些幻想中，那些弥合差距并引入可喜的模棱两可元素的人物出现了。即使是哈利-波特，青少年消费者的理想化，也有一个精英血统，将他与泥巴人区分开来。但多萝西几乎不是一个贵族，她进入的奥兹国从一开始就很模糊，是一种共存和相互依赖的道德和想象力技术的胜利。一种是古老的童话和奇幻文学，邪恶的女巫和不结盟的帮手，作为边缘人物的自然媒介，会说话的动物和被施了魔法的鞋子。另一个是鲍姆的，他最崇高的发明是这个非同寻常的地方和日常的东西并存并相互映照。当好女巫说奥兹国比奥兹国的其他女巫 "更强大 "时，她在为读者准备这本书中最温和但最吸引人的讽刺。"我怎么能不成为一个笨蛋呢，"他在被揭穿后说，"当所有这些人让我做大家都知道不能做的事情时，我怎么能不成为一个笨蛋呢？"(第162-163页)。但是，当然，他们不知道。绿野仙踪的力量最终取决于他的观众的轻信和他的供需意识。就像他自己承认的那样，他可能根本不是什么巫师。但他仍然是一个相当好的美国推销员。而在奥兹国，推销术--美国对西方文化价值的不可能的贡献--比巫术更强大。</p></div>

<p class ="en">4 Mark Evan Swartz, author of Oz Before the Rainbow, chronicles the evolution of adaptations of The Wizard of Oz and demonstrates the inaccuracy of blaming MGM and Victor Fleming for all these changes. As early as the 1910 one-reel silent version of the novel, which itself inherited elements from the 1902 stage version, film-makers, some of them with Baum’s blessing, had begun blurring the line between Kansas and Oz. One way to look at the 1939 film adaptation is that it was a vast improvement on changes already introduced in earlier adaptations and raised several stop-gaps and audience concessions to the level of high art.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">4彩虹前的 绿野仙踪》一书的作者Mark Evan Swartz记录了《绿野仙踪》改编的演变过程，并证明了将所有这些变化归咎于米高梅和维克多-弗莱明是不准确的。早在1910年这部小说的单卷无声版中，电影制作人，其中一些人得到了鲍姆的祝福，就已经开始模糊堪萨斯和奥兹国之间的界限了。看待1939年的电影改编的一种方式是，它对早期改编中已经引入的变化进行了巨大的改进，并将一些漏洞和观众的让步提高到了高级艺术的水平。</p></div>

Heinz Mohr (whose Lexikon der Symbole, Düsseldorf und Köln: Diederichs, 1981, is referenced in Biedermann), “Christian symbolism finds green ‘equidistant from the blue of heaven, the red of hell . . . an intermediate and mediating color, soothing, refreshing, human, a color of contemplation, of the expectation of resurrection” (Biedermann, p. 158). Color analysis based on traditional value assignments, moreover, would have to explain why it is that Glinda’s holdings, the Land of the Quadlings, is marked in red on the map of Oz that Baum created and that the Wicked Witch controlled the Winkie Country, which is colored yellow.</p></div>

<p class ="en">Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas rairies, with Uncle Henry, who as a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">多萝西住在堪萨斯州的大草原上，与作为农民的亨利叔叔和作为农民妻子的艾姨一起生活。他们的房子很小，因为建造房子的木材需要用马车运到很多地方。有四面墙，一个地板和一个屋顶，这构成了一个房间；这个房间里有一个看起来很生锈的炉子，一个放餐具的柜子，一张桌子，三或四把椅子，还有床。亨利叔叔和艾姆婶婶在一个角落里有一张大床，多萝西在另一个角落里有一张小床。这里根本没有阁楼，也没有地窖--只有一个在地上挖的小洞，叫旋风地窖，万一有大旋风刮起，足以压垮沿途的任何建筑物，一家人就可以去那里。地板中间有一个活板门，从那里有一个梯子通向这个小而黑暗的洞。</p></div>

<p class ="en">When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.1</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">当多萝西站在门口环顾四周时，除了四面的灰色大草原，她什么也看不到。没有一棵树，也没有一座房子，打破了四面八方伸向天空边缘的广阔平坦的土地。太阳把耕地烤成了灰色的一团，上面有一些小裂缝。甚至连草也不是绿色的，因为太阳已经把长长的草叶顶部烧焦了，直到它们变成了随处可见的相同灰色。房子曾经刷过漆，但太阳把漆泡坏了，雨水又把它冲走了，现在房子和其他东西一样，都是暗淡的灰色。1</p></div>

<p class ="en">When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled, now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">艾姨来到那里生活时，她是一个年轻漂亮的妻子。阳光和风也改变了她。它们夺走了她眼睛里的光芒，留下了沉郁的灰色；它们夺走了她脸颊和嘴唇上的红色，它们也变成了灰色。她瘦了，憔悴了，而且现在从不笑了。当身为孤儿的多萝西第一次来到她身边时，艾姨被孩子的笑声吓了一跳，以至于每当多萝西欢快的声音传到她的耳朵里时，她都会尖叫着用手按住自己的心脏；她仍然好奇地看着这个小女孩，她能找到任何可以笑的东西。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.</p></div>

<p class ="en">The cyclone had set the house down, very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of green sward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.3</p></div>

<p class ="en">Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were blue; the little woman’s hat was white,4 and she wore a white gown that hung in plaits from her shoulders; over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older: her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.</p></div>

<p class ="en">After a few hours the road began o be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow brick, which were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length on the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing merrily at his own mishap.</p></div>

She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman11 who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.</p></div>

The leg worked very well, once I was used to it; but my action angered the wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinner, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinner happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.</p></div>

She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinner came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.</p></div>

There was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the hap piest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”</p></div>

<p class ="en">“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.”</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"这是个谜，"狮子回答说。"我想我生来就是这样的。森林里的所有其他动物自然希望我是勇敢的，因为狮子到处被认为是百兽之王。我了解到，如果我非常大声地吼叫，每个生物都会受到惊吓而避开我的道路。每当我遇到一个人，我都非常害怕；但我只是向他吼叫，他总是以最快的速度跑开。如果大象、老虎和熊曾经想和我打架，我应该自己跑，我就是这么一个胆小鬼；但是只要它们听到我的吼声，就都想从我身边逃走，我当然会让它们走。"</p></div>

<p class ="en">During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.</p></div>

And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts13 and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm and she slept soundly until morning.</p></div>

<p class ="en">The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass towards them. It was, indeed, a great, yellow wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field-mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">铁皮人刚要回答，就听到一声低沉的吼叫，他转过头（铰链的作用很好），看到一只奇怪的野兽从草地上向他们奔来。这的确是一只巨大的黄色野猫，木头人认为它一定是在追赶什么东西，因为它的耳朵紧贴着头，嘴巴大张着，露出两排丑陋的牙齿，而它红色的眼睛像火球一样闪闪发光。当它走近时，铁皮人看到在野兽面前奔跑的是一只灰色的小田鼠，虽然他没有心，但他知道野猫试图杀死这样一个漂亮、无害的生物是不对的。</p></div>

When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">于是多萝西向她所有的朋友告别，除了托托，她抱着狗，跟着绿姑娘走过七条通道，上了三层楼梯21直到他们来到宫殿前面的一个房间。那是世界上最温馨的小房间，有一张柔软舒适的床，床单是绿色的丝绸，还有绿色的天鹅绒对襟布。房间中间有一个小喷泉，向空中喷出绿色的香水，又落到一个雕刻精美的绿色大理石盆里。美丽的绿色花朵矗立在窗前，还有一个架子，上面有一排绿色的小书。当多萝西有时间打开这些书时，她发现里面全是奇怪的绿色图片，让她大笑，它们是如此有趣。</p></div>

<p class ="en">She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">她让多萝西一个人呆着，又去找其他人。她也把这些人领到了房间里，他们每个人都发现自己住在皇宫里一个非常愉快的地方。当然，这种礼貌在稻草人身上被浪费了；因为当他发现自己独自在房间里时，他愚蠢地站在一个地方，就在门口，等待天亮。躺下也不能让他休息，他也不能闭上眼睛；所以他整晚都在盯着一只在房间一角织网的小蜘蛛，就好像这不是世界上最美妙的房间之一一样。铁皮人因习惯而躺在床上，因为他记得自己是肉做的；但他无法入睡，整夜都在上下移动他的关节，以确保它们保持良好的工作状态。狮子宁愿选择森林里的干树叶床，也不喜欢被关在房间里；但他太理智了，不会因为这个而担心，所以他窜到床上，像猫一样把自己卷起来，一会儿就呼呼大睡。</p></div>

It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.</p></div>

Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given. But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.</p></div>

<p class ="en">The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg, in return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the bood in her had dried up many years before.</p></div>

<p class ="en">Dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.</p></div>

<p class ="en">Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore. Her Bees and her Crows and her Wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way.</p></div>

She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off, and before she could reach it the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.</p></div>

After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the court-yard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.30</p></div>

<p class ="en">The You will remember there was no oad—not even a pathway—between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travellers went in search of the Witch she had seen them com ng, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">你会记得在邪恶女巫的城堡和翡翠城之间没有道路，甚至没有一条小路。当四个旅行者去寻找女巫时，她看到他们来了，于是派翼猴把他们带到她那里。在大片的毛茛和黄菊花中找到他们回来的路，比他们被带着走要难得多。他们当然知道，他们必须向东直走，朝着太阳升起的方向走；他们开始走在正确的路上。但到了中午，当太阳在他们头上时，他们不知道哪个是东，哪个是西，这就是他们在大田里迷路的原因。然而，他们继续行走，到了晚上，月亮出来了，照得很亮。于是他们躺在香甜的黄花丛中，睡得很香，直到天亮--除了稻草人和铁皮人。</p></div>

Perhaps some of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who walked in the forest.

All her magic was used to help the people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.</p></div>

One day, just before the wedding, my grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.</p></div>

But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whomsoever he may be.”</p></div>

<p class ="en">“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I’d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">"是的，当然，"奥兹回答。"我已经厌倦了做这种虚伪的人。如果我走出这个宫殿，我的人民很快就会发现我不是一个巫师，然后他们会因为我欺骗了他们而生气。所以我不得不整天关在这些房间里，这让我感到厌烦。我更愿意和你一起回到堪萨斯州，再次参加马戏团。"</p></div>

First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long.</p></div>

<p class ="en">The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and it’s body covered with coarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the monster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with sharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down, he watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite dead.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">狮子发现这只大蜘蛛时，它正躺在床上睡觉，它的样子非常丑陋，以至于它的敌人厌恶地抬起鼻子。它的腿和老虎说的一样长，身上长满了粗大的黑毛。它有一张大嘴，一排尖锐的牙齿有一英尺长；但它的头和胖胖的身体相连，脖子像黄蜂的腰一样纤细。这给狮子提示了攻击这个怪物的最佳方法，由于他知道在睡梦中与它搏斗比醒着时更容易，他猛地一跳，直接落在怪物的背上。然后，他用沉重的爪子一击，将蜘蛛的头从它的身体上打了下来，他的爪子都是锋利的。他跳下来，看着它，直到它的长腿不再扭动，这时他知道它已经死了。</p></div>

<p class ="en">36 (p. 149) “I am everywhere”: Is this a parody of the language of traditional Revelation (which features both a good deal of green as well as emerald)? There is little or no overt parody in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz—certainly nothing like what one finds in British children’s fantasy of the period—and no vicious satire. On the other hand, Baum’s theosophical interests and his gently dismissive attitude toward conventional religion may be at work here. Rogers points out his “personal interest in nontraditional religion and opposition to the organized churches” of his day (as well as his support of women’s suffrage) is on record in the editorials that he wrote in 1890 and 1891 for the Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer, in which he advances the claims of Theosophy and at times sounds like a Jeffersonian Deist.

<p class ="en">L. Frank Baum wrote thirteen sequels to the original Oz tale, elaborating on the fantastic inhabitants of that enchanted land. He dedicated the first sequel, The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904), to David C. Montgomery and Fred A. Stone, the actors who played the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow in Baum’s successful musical The Wizard of Oz (discussed below). In The Marvelous Land of Oz, the Scarecrow, whom the Wizard named as his successor at the end of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, enjoys his position as ruler of Oz. (The prominence of the Scarecrow in the 1904 book, which does not feature Dorothy, was most likely the result of his stage counterpart’s great popularity.) Baum seems to have written The Marvelous Land of Oz with an eye toward stage adaptation: Part of the plot involves an army of women—easily imagined as high-kicking chorus girls—who challenge the Scarecrow’s legitimacy. The plot’s entanglements unwind at the hand of Glinda the Good Sorceress, who reveals that the young boy Tip is really Ozma, the rightful ruler of Oz, magically transformed into a boy by the wicked witch Mombi. Though the plot surprise may seem unorthodox, sex changes were familiar in popular theater of the day. Glinda then compels Mombi to restore Ozma to her true form.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">L.弗兰克-鲍姆为最初的奥兹国故事写了13部续集，详细介绍了那片神奇土地上的神奇居民。他将第一部续集《神奇的奥兹国》（1904年）献给了大卫-C-蒙哥马利和弗雷德-A-斯通，他们是在鲍姆的成功音乐剧《绿野仙踪》（下文将讨论）中扮演铁皮人和稻草人的演员。在《神奇的奥兹国》中，稻草人在《神奇的奥兹国》的结尾被巫师指定为他的继承人，享受着他作为奥兹国统治者的地位。(稻草人在1904年的书中的突出地位，并没有多萝西的身影，很可能是由于他的舞台伙伴非常受欢迎的结果）。鲍姆写《神奇的奥兹国》时似乎考虑到了舞台改编的问题。部分情节涉及到一支女性军队--很容易被想象成高踢腿的合唱团女孩--她们挑战稻草人的合法性。情节的纠葛在善良的女巫格林达手中解开，她揭示了小男孩蒂普实际上是奥兹国的合法统治者奥兹玛，被邪恶的女巫蒙比神奇地变成了一个男孩。虽然这个情节的惊喜可能看起来不合常理，但在当时的流行戏剧中，变性是很常见的。格琳达随后强迫蒙比将奥兹玛恢复到她的真实形态。</p></div>

She also appears at the ends of Tik-Tok of Oz, The Scarecrow of Oz, and Rinkitink in Oz. Baum’s imaginative powers shine particularly in The Emerald City of Oz and in the final four novels.

<p class ="en">Inspired by the commercial success of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum quickly adapted his novel for the stage. The 1902 musical comedy The Wizard of Oz, which replaced Toto with Imogene the cow, was a popular success; it opened in Chicago, moved to Broadway, where it played for more than a year, and toured until 1911. A ten-minute silent film version of the play appeared in 1910; it was one of three films based on Baum’s books to appear that year. The other two films were based on a combination of The Marvelous Land of Oz and Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz and the non-Oz story John Dough and the Cherub. Baum also wrote scripts and songs for two other Oz musicals. The Woggle-Bug, Baum’s dramatization of The Marvelous Land of Oz, premiered in Chicago in 1905, soon after the novel’s publication. The play, named after a giant professorial insect who roams Oz, ran for less than a month. It was followed in 1913 by the musical The Tik-Tok Man of Oz, which features Tik-Tok, Betsy Bobbin, and others from the books Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz and The Road to Oz, and plot elements Baum reused in the book Tik-Tok of Oz.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">受到《绿野仙踪》的商业成功的启发，弗兰克-鲍姆很快将他的小说改编为舞台剧。1902年的音乐喜剧《绿野仙踪》用母牛伊莫金代替了图图，获得了巨大的成功；它在芝加哥开演，转到百老汇，在那里演出了一年多，并一直巡演到1911年。该剧的10分钟无声电影版于1910年出现；它是当年出现的三部基于鲍姆书籍的电影之一。另外两部电影是根据《神奇的奥兹国》和《多萝西和奥兹国的魔法师》以及非奥兹国的故事《约翰-道夫和小天使》组合而成的。鲍姆还为另外两部奥兹国音乐剧写了剧本和歌曲。The Woggle-Bug是鲍姆对《神奇的奥兹国》的戏剧化，在小说出版后不久，于1905年在芝加哥首演。该剧以一只在奥兹国游荡的巨型教授级昆虫命名，演出时间不到一个月。紧随其后的是1913年的音乐剧《奥兹国的嘀嗒人》，其中的嘀嗒人、贝茜-鲍宾和其他来自《多萝西和奥兹国的魔法师》和《奥兹国之路》的人，以及鲍姆在《奥兹国的嘀嗒 人》一书中重新使用的情节元素。</p></div>

<p class ="en">A quarter century later, Oz made a splash on Broadway once again. Based on Gregory Maguire’s best-selling novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995), the musical Wicked opened in 2003 and won three Tony Awards. The intelligent, multilayered novel tells the life story of the Wicked Witch of the West, one of the most notorious villains in literature. Maguire’s story humanizes the witch, whom he names Elphaba, by describing her difficult childhood as the only green-skinned girl at school. Raised by an alcoholic mother and plagued by her room-mate Glinda, a shallow girl interested only in clothes and popularity, the studious Elphaba eventually sets out to overthrow the corrupt Wizard who has overtaken Oz. Wicked has the same ending as Baum’s original tale, but in the retelling Maguire paints a vivid and sympathetic portrait of a well-developed character who is both fiery and appealing.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">四分之一世纪后，《奥兹国》再次在百老汇引起轰动。根据格雷戈里-马奎尔（Gregory Maguire）的畅销小说《邪恶》（Wicked）改编。恶人的生活和时代》（1995年），音乐剧《恶人》于2003年开演并赢得了三项托尼奖。这部充满智慧、多层次的小说讲述了西方邪恶女巫的生活故事，她是文学史上最臭名昭著的恶棍之一。马奎尔的故事通过描述女巫作为学校里唯一的绿皮肤女孩的艰难童年，将女巫人性化，他为她取名为Elphaba。她被一个酗酒的母亲抚养长大，并被她的室友格林达（Glinda）所困扰，格林达是一个只对衣服和人气感兴趣的浅薄女孩，好学的艾尔法巴最终开始推翻统治了奥兹国的腐败巫师的统治。邪恶》的结局与鲍姆的原版故事相同，但在重述中，马奎尔为一个发展良好的角色描绘了一个生动而令人同情的形象，她既火热又吸引人。</p></div>

<p class ="en">In the last century, more than one hundred feature and television films have been made based on Baum’s Oz novels. Many of the earliest of these were spearheaded by Baum himself. Pursuing his interest in filmmaking, Baum co-produced The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914), which was based on a popular Oz sequel and was made by Baum’s Oz Film Manufacturing Company. The company was also responsible for The Magic Cloak of Oz (1914; released in 1917) and His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz (1914). In 1925 Baum’s son Frank Joslyn Baum co-wrote the screenplay with director Leon Lee for The Wizard of Oz, a film that features Oliver Hardy as the Tin Woodman.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">在上个世纪，根据鲍姆的奥兹国小说制作的故事片和电视片已超过100部。其中许多最早的影片是由鲍姆本人带头拍摄的。为了追求他对电影制作的兴趣，鲍姆共同制作了《奥兹国的拼布女孩》（1914年），该片是根据奥兹国流行的续集改编的，由鲍姆的奥兹国电影制造公司拍摄。该公司还负责《奥兹国的魔法斗篷》（1914年；1917年发行）和《奥兹国的稻草人陛下》（1914年）。1925年，鲍姆的儿子弗兰克-乔斯林-鲍姆与导演莱昂-李共同编写了《绿野仙踪》的剧本，这部电影由奥利弗-哈迪扮演铁皮樵夫。</p></div>

<p class ="en">But the release of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz—a work that has in many ways eclipsed Baum’s novel in the cultural consciousness—changed everything. It has been said that more people have seen The Wizard of Oz than any other movie. Its magnificence and impact are even more surprising given the difficulty of producing the film. Nominally directed by Victor Fleming, Wizard required a clutch of directors to save it from disaster. The original director, Richard Thorpe, was fired after twelve days of shooting, and the legendary George Cukor did not last a week. Though Fleming shot the bulk of the picture, King Vidor took over near the end of the process to film the Kansas sequences, including the famous “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” scene, which was nearly cut from the film. Salmon Rushdie, in his seminal study of the film, writes “Who, then, is the auteur of The Wizard of Oz? No single writer can claim that honour, not even the author of the original book.” Indeed, the screenplay was penned by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf, as well as a host of un-credited writers.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">但是，1939年电影《绿野仙踪》的上映--这部作品在许多方面使鲍姆的小说在文化意识中黯然失色，改变了一切。有人说，看过《绿野仙踪》的人比其他任何电影都多。考虑到制作这部电影的难度，它的辉煌和影响甚至更令人惊讶。名义上由维克多-弗莱明（Victor Fleming）执导的《绿野仙踪》需要一批导演来挽救它的灾难。原先的导演理查德-索普在拍摄了12天后就被解雇了，而富有传奇色彩的乔治-库克也没有坚持一个星期。尽管弗莱明拍摄了影片的大部分内容，但国王-维多在拍摄过程接近尾声时接管了堪萨斯州的场景，包括著名的 "彩虹之上 "场景，该场景几乎被从影片中删去。Salmon Rushdie在他关于这部电影的开创性研究中写道："那么，谁是《绿野仙踪》的作者？没有任何一位作家可以宣称有此殊荣，甚至连原书的作者也不行"。事实上，剧本是由诺埃尔-兰利、弗洛伦斯-瑞尔森和埃德加-艾伦-伍尔夫，以及许多未署名的作家共同撰写的。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Serendipitously, however, The Wizard of Oz is near perfect, in part due to sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s star-making turn as Dorothy Gale, the ebullient score, which features “Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead,” “Follow the Yellow Brick Road,” and “We’re Off to See the Wizard,” and a wonderfully creative adaptation of Baum’s original ideas. For example, in the film Oz is a dream place to which Dorothy travels while unconscious. The Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion all correlate to farmhands employed by Auntie Em, and the Wizard himself is an alchemized Professor Marvel, whom Dorothy had met on his travels through Kansas. And, in a stroke of cinematic genius, it was decided to shoot the Kansas scenes that frame the film in black and white—actually in a drab, sepia tint—and the Oz sequences in brilliant Technicolor. At the time of the film’s production, nearly all films were still shot in black and white, so this shift to color as Dorothy enters the enchanted realm of Oz would have had an extraordinary impact on audiences.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">然而，偶然的是，《绿野仙踪》近乎完美，部分原因是16岁的朱迪-加兰饰演的多萝西-盖尔成为明星，热情洋溢的配乐，其中包括 "叮咚！女巫死了 "和 "我们去看魔法师"。女巫死了"、"沿着黄砖路 "和 "我们去看巫师 "等热情洋溢的配乐，以及对鲍姆原著的精彩创意改编。例如，在影片中，奥兹国是一个梦境，多萝西在昏迷中前往。铁皮人、稻草人和胆小的狮子都与艾姨雇用的农夫有关，而魔法师本人是一个炼金术的马维尔教授，多萝西在堪萨斯州的旅行中曾遇到他。而且，在电影的天才之作中，决定用黑白色调拍摄堪萨斯州的场景--实际上是用单调的棕褐色色调，而用明亮的技术彩色拍摄奥兹国的情节。在影片制作的时候，几乎所有的电影都还是用黑白拍摄的，所以当多萝西进入奥兹国的魔幻世界时，这种彩色的转变会对观众产生非凡的影响。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Called the greatest year in American cinema, 1939 saw the appearance of a host of films now considered classics, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Stagecoach, Wuthering Heights, and Gone with the Wind, which was also directed by Fleming and which dominated the Academy Awards that year. But Wizard won two Oscars in the musical categories: Original Score and Best Song for “Over the Rainbow,” with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by E. Y. Harburg. Additionally, Judy Garland picked up a special Oscar “for her outstanding performance as a screen juvenile during the past year.”</p></div>

<p class ="cn">1939年被称为美国电影最伟大的一年，出现了许多现在被认为是经典的电影，包括《史密斯先生去华盛顿》、《驿站》、《呼啸山庄》和《乱世佳人》，后者也是由弗莱明执导的，并在该年的奥斯卡奖中占据主导地位。但《巫师》在音乐剧类别中赢得了两项奥斯卡奖。原创音乐和最佳歌曲 "Over the Rainbow"，音乐由哈罗德-阿伦（Harold Arlen）创作，歌词由E.Y. Harburg创作。此外，朱迪-加兰获得了一项特别的奥斯卡奖，"以表彰她在过去一年中作为银幕少年的杰出表现"。</p></div>

<p class ="en">The Wizard of Oz has become one of America’s most important contributions to cinema, as well as an exemplar to which filmmak ers consistently allude. For instance, when adapting Barry Gifford’s novel Wild at Heart for his film of the same name (1990), David Lynch imposed a Wizard of Oz structure—replete with a cackling witch and a snakeskin jacket standing in for the Silver Shoes/Ruby Slippers—to give the story a happy ending. This same fidelity of audiences to 1939’s Wizard has doomed all subsequent attempts at Oz sequels.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">绿野仙踪》已成为美国对电影最重要的贡献之一，同时也是电影人不断提及的典范。例如，大卫-林奇在将巴里-吉福德的小说《狂野的心》改编为他的同名电影（1990年）时，强加了一个《绿野仙踪》的结构--其中有一个咯咯笑的女巫和一件蛇皮夹克来代替银鞋/红拖鞋，以给故事一个快乐的结局。观众对1939年《绿野仙踪》的这种忠贞不渝的态度注定了后来所有奥兹国续集的尝试。</p></div>

<p class ="en">Disney’s Return to Oz (1985), directed by Oscar-winning editor Walter Murch, is a competent, ambitious rendition of Baum’s novels The Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. Return to Oz features spectacular visuals, which, though invidious comparisons to Wizard are inevitably made, bear the stamp of W. W. Denslow’s original book illustrations. Starring Piper Lau rie as Auntie Em and Fairuza Balk in her debut role as Dorothy, Murch’s film parades a slew of characters, including the artfully realized Tik-Tok; the sweet Jack Pumpkinhead; and the hunched-over Wheelers, whose terrifying, squeaking wheels always precede them on screen.</p></div>

<p class ="en">It is impossible to conceive of a greater contrast than exists between the children’s books of antiquity that were new publications during the sixteenth century and modern children’s books of which “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” is typical. The crudeness that was characteristic of the old-time publications that were intended for the delectation and amusement of ancestral children would now be enough to cause the modern child to yell with rage and vigor and to instantly reject the offending volume, if not to throw it out of the window. The time when anything was considered good enough for children has long since passed, and the volumes devoted to our youth are based upon the fact that they are the future citizens: that they are the country’s hope, and are thus worthy of the best, not the worst, that art can give. . . . In “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” the fact is clearly recognized that the young as well as their elders love novelty. They are pleased with dashes of color and something new in place of the old, familiar, and winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen.</p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn">在十六世纪新出版的古代儿童读物和现代儿童读物之间，不可能想象出更大的反差，《绿野仙踪》就是其中的典型。古代出版物的特点是粗俗，这些出版物是为了让祖先的孩子们高兴和娱乐，而现在却足以让现代的孩子愤怒地大喊大叫，并立即拒绝这本违规的书，如果不是把它从窗户扔出去的话。任何东西都被认为对儿童足够好的时代早已过去，专门为我们的年轻人编写的书卷是基于这样一个事实，即他们是未来的公民：他们是国家的希望，因此值得得到艺术所能提供的最好而不是最坏的东西。. . .在《神奇的绿野仙踪》中，人们清楚地认识到，年轻人和他们的长辈一样喜欢新奇的东西。他们对色彩的闪烁和新的东西感到高兴，以取代格林和安徒生那些古老的、熟悉的、带翅膀的仙女。</p></div>

<p class ="en">The Wizard of Oz is a film whose driving force is the inadequacy of adults, even of good adults, and how the weakness of grown-ups forces children to take control of their own destinies, and so, ironically, grow up themselves. The journey from Kansas to Oz is a rite of passage from a world in which Dorothy’s parent-substitutes, Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, are powerless to help her save her dog Toto from the marauding Miss Gulch, into a world where the people are her own size, and in which she is never, ever treated as a child but as a heroine.</p></div>

<p class ="cn">绿野仙踪》是一部电影，其驱动力是成年人的不足，即使是好的成年人，以及成年人的弱点如何迫使儿童掌握自己的命运，因此，具有讽刺意味的是，他们自己也长大了。从堪萨斯州到奥兹国的旅程是一种成人仪式，在这个世界上，多萝西的父母替代品艾姨和亨利叔叔无力帮助她从掠夺的古尔奇小姐手中拯救她的狗托托，进入一个人们与她一样大小的世界，在这个世界上，她从来没有被当作一个孩子，而是被当作一个女英雄。</p></div>

Usually the hero or heroine does do or find something that will from that point forward give meaning to his or her life, but that which is found or accomplished is seldom what was expected. Is Dorothy on a quest? Is her quest successful? If so, what was the quest for? What did she, in fact, gain from it in the end?</p></div>
