<div id="calibre_link-1184" class="class9">Prologue</div>
<div class="class10">Ouzouk woke up with the first rays of sunlight hitting his face. He scanned the interior of his dusty hut, constructed with twigs, mud and dry grass. He scratched his back, which, as always, had been bitten by insects over and over again throughout the night. Grateful that the night had passed without any danger to his family, he crawled out, careful not to make any sounds.</div>
<div class="class14">It was a crisp and clear morning. He would have loved to take his family for a walk around the waterfall and play with his little son, but there was work to do. It had been five days since the tribe ate something more substantial than a fistful of berries. Unfazed by the bloodthirsty mosquitoes buzzing by, Ouzouk walked over to the fire pit and warmed his calloused hands. The light scent of wood smoke filled his nostrils. He rubbed his hands together, still feeling the painful absence of his index finger lost during that fateful hunt many moons ago.</div>
<div class="class14">One by one, his fellow tribesmen crawled out of their huts and joined him at the fire. There was Dhizgab, his friend who was bitten by a snake and was left partly paralyzed on his left side. Gnokk limped along next, with his broken foot badly healed, and a part of his skull partly caved in after a stone thrown by an enemy tribesman hit him smack dab in the middle of his forehead. Rekknodd sauntered into the group next. So far, he was the luckiest of the band, with only a deep scar on his cheek, left from an attack by a tiger that had massacred a half of the tribe. Other men&mdash;some missing limbs, <span id="calibre_link-1185"></span>
some having lost their entire families, some with even more horrible memories&mdash;joined the group.</div>
<div class="class14">When the men were ready, they separated into two groups and ventured out to secure food for the tribe. They made it back to the camp in the early afternoon, forced to make a hasty retreat after spotting a leopard resting in the thick bushes. Yet again, they had failed to obtain food, but at least they were grateful that (unlike two moons ago) this time nobody had been hurt.</div>
<div class="class14">With empty stomachs, the adults gathered around the fire pit while small children, supervised by teenagers armed with spears and bows, played by the creek a short distance from the camp.</div>
<div class="class14">They reluctantly decided that the area could no longer support them. While clean water was plentiful and predators rare, food was becoming increasingly scarce and successful hunts were few and far between.</div>
<div class="class14">The next day they would gather their belongings, put them on their backs, and walk for a long time until they would find another suitable place for a new temporary dwelling. Some would die along the way, some would get hurt, but such was life, Ouzouk thought to himself. A human being couldn’t <span class="class11">ever</span>
 stop struggling and fighting to survive each day.</div>
<div class="class14">I can hear you thinking, “What a weird prologue to a book about self-discipline!” Bear with me, please…</div>
<div class="class14">Our basic human nature hasn’t changed since the days of Ouzouk. While the vast majority of humans fortunately no longer have to live in constant discomfort and fear of death, we would still <span id="calibre_link-1186"></span>
do well to possess even a fraction of mental toughness and self-discipline our ancestors had. In the modern world, it’s easy to live without even a modicum of self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">Back then, nobody could avoid discomfort. It was a fact of life that one couldn’t thrive unless they ventured into the world, facing unknown risks and possible death in a quest for a better life.</div>
<div class="class14">Today, most people are unable to wake up early without an alarm clock, and even then, it takes them thirty minutes just to crawl out of bed. Most would find it impossible to sleep on the bare floor, with insects crawling over them and biting their bodies the entire night. If they experienced just a slight ache, most would skip work and complain about how much pain they were in. Most wouldn’t be able to fast for an entire day, let alone go without food for five days in a row.</div>
<div class="class14">Compared to our ancestors, we have it <span class="class11">easy</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Yet, or perhaps because of it, so many people struggle with self-discipline today. A great majority of them do nothing to fix that, and the ones who try are often met with ridicule. If you belong to the group that is trying to better themselves or wanting to do so, the book you’re now reading is for you.</div>
<div class="class14">I wrote <span class="class11">365 Days With Self-Discipline</span>
 with the intention of creating a daily companion to help you embrace self-discipline in your everyday life.</div>
<div class="class14">As the author of several bestselling books about self-discipline and being a personal growth junkie myself, self-control is a topic close to my heart. I believe that if a person wants to reach their full <span id="calibre_link-1187"></span>
potential, he or she can’t avoid discomfort. Doing things that might not be entirely pleasant is key to achieving long-term objectives.</div>
<div class="class14">In the following pages, I’ll share with you one thought for each day of a year that is devoted to the topic of self-discipline, mental toughness, success, or self-improvement in general. The thoughts come from some of the world’s brightest minds: successful entrepreneurs, athletes, bestselling authors, researchers, performers, bloggers, and more.</div>
<div class="class14">Since the entries are brief and get straight to the heart of the matter, you’ll be able to quickly find ongoing inspiration to continue working on your most important long-term goals and on becoming an ever better person.</div>
<div class="class14">Due to the large number of days in a year, some themes will inevitably repeat, but I strove to address each subtopic from different perspectives. Please note that I have quoted various people from numerous sources, including books, articles, blogs, speeches, interviews, and more. By citing their words, I don’t necessarily endorse their works or their persona.</div>
<div class="class14">(A note on quotes in the physical and ebook version of the book &mdash; whenever I could, I cited the source and included an endnote. Unfortunately, the exact source of a small number of quotes, particularly those by historic figures, was elusive to me. Whenever I couldn’t find the author &mdash; as is often the case with many inspirational quotes circulating around the Internet &mdash; instead of risking misattribution I wrote “Unknown.”<span id="calibre_link-1188"></span>

<div class="class14">Let’s turn the page and start with Day 1 and the most important thought that defines the difference between a self-disciplined person and a weak-willed one.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-292" class="class19">Day 1: On Living the Hard Way</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Self-discipline means living your life the hard way: resisting temptations and instant gratification, in order to receive bigger and better rewards in the future. It’s certainly <span class="class11">easier</span>
 to avoid all kinds of discomfort and indulge yourself whenever you want, but in the end, all that you get from that approach is fleeting pleasure <span class="class11">now</span>
 at the expense of your future, which otherwise could have been much better.</div>
<div class="class14">Consider a weak-willed person who, when faced with a challenge, immediately opts out. How likely is this person to achieve anything substantial in life if their primary value is to feel comfortable? How is this person going to manage a crisis that they <span class="class11">must</span>
 face? Even a relatively insignificant problem can become an insurmountable obstacle for a person who’s been living a sheltered life and always avoided what’s difficult or disagreeable.</div>
<div class="class14">Now contrast that with a person who <span class="class11">voluntarily</span>
 makes his or her life harder. They seek out and welcome challenges as opportunities to grow. Each self-imposed affliction strengthens them, so that fewer and fewer difficulties in life overwhelm them. Day by day, they immunize themselves against problems, precisely <span id="calibre_link-1190"></span>
because they seek them out. When life deals them an unexpected blow, they’re ready to handle it because &mdash; thanks to living their lives the hard way &mdash; they’re <span class="class11">always</span>
 ready for hardships.<br class="calibre" />

<div class="class14">Eat this greasy, high-calorie hamburger or prepare a healthy salad? Sleep in and barely get to work on time or wake up at 5 a.m. to work on your side business before going to work at your day job? Stop trying the moment you get rejected or swallow your pride and keep going, despite hearing “no” dozens of times?</div>
<div class="class14">It takes only a moment to make the wrong choice and jeopardize your future. What feels like an insignificant decision today can have a great, lasting impact on your future.</div>
<div class="class14">Each choice sets a precedent &mdash; and when you make the same wrong choice several times in a row, it becomes your standard <span class="class11">modus operandi</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">While one hamburger every now and then isn’t likely to ruin your overall efforts to lose weight, underestimating the impact of <span class="class11">repeatedly</span>
 making the wrong choice can profoundly affect you over the course of the rest of your life.</div>
<div class="class14">Each time you’re faced with a decision between exerting self-discipline and taking it easy, remind yourself that the choice you’re making today doesn’t affect the present moment alone. A momentary decision can (and often will) reverberate for many years or even decades into the future.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1193" class="class9">Day 3: On Being a Human</div>
<div class="class20">Willpower is what separates us from the animals. It’s the capacity to restrain our impulses, resist temptation &mdash; do what’s right and good for us in the long run, not what we want to do right now. It’s central, in fact, to civilization.</div>

<div class="class14">Humans have the capacity to act against their urges in exchange for a better future. Unfortunately, many people live by the principle of “if it feels good, do it, and if it doesn’t, don’t do it.”</div>
<div class="class14">Caving in to your temptations whenever you feel them emerge is like relinquishing your humanity, in a way. As an intelligent human being, you have an ability &mdash; and I daresay an <span class="class11">obligation</span>
 &mdash; to make decisions that are based on rational thinking, not on your instincts alone.</div>
<div class="class14">Strive to be a better human and embrace your humanity by exercising your “willpower muscle,” instead of succumbing to your most primal (and least helpful for your long-term goals) part of the brain. Your most primal instincts may provide temporary comfort, but seldom are good for the long term, except when there is a direct threat to your survival.</div>

<div class="class20">I value self-discipline, but creating systems that make it next to impossible to misbehave is more reliable than self-control.</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;Tim Ferriss</span>
<span id="calibre_link-636"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-635" class="class23">4</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">A lot of people think that being self-disciplined means that you can sit in front of a delicious piece of cake and stare at it for hours without eating it. They think of resisting temptations as being like a knight defending his kingdom against the invader.</div>
<div class="class14">If you go to seedy bars every week, your chances of getting punched in the face are higher than those of a person spending their evenings at home with a book. Likewise, the best way to protect yourself against temptations is to avoid them &mdash; and for that, plain old preparation is more valuable than self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">Your chances of cheating on a diet are higher if you have forbidden foods at home. Removing them from your house &mdash; a simple act that requires little willpower, as long as you’re satiated while doing so &mdash; will protect you when you get hungry and the urge to gorge on them hits you like a ton of bricks.</div>
<div class="class14">Your chances of sleeping in are lower if you set three different alarms and place them away from your bed.</div>
<div class="class14">You’ll be less likely to waste time at work when you block the most distracting websites instead of relying on your willpower to stop you before loading those funny cat pictures.</div>
<div class="class14">Prepare yourself for difficult situations by putting up roadblocks ahead of time, when your resolve isn’t being tested. Your self-<span id="calibre_link-1196"></span>
control <span class="class11">system</span>
 will do some of the heavy lifting for you, leaving your reserves of self-discipline to be used for the unplanned situations, when they arise.<br class="calibre" />

<div class="class20">Before complaining that you are a slave to another, be sure that you are not a slave to self. Look within; you will find there, perchance, slavish thoughts, slavish desires, and in your daily life and conduct slavish habits. Conquer these; cease to be a slave to self, and no man will have the power to enslave you.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-670" class="class23">5</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">It’s easy to delegate the responsibility for our lives and choices to other people.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s not your fault that you can’t stick to a diet &mdash; it’s because your friends constantly tempt you to grab something to eat with them.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s not your fault that you can’t control your finances &mdash; it’s those evil corporations that spend millions on advertising and leave you powerless to change.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s not that you lack willpower to exercise &mdash; people always want something from you and you never have the time to develop this healthy habit.</div>
<div class="class14">In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. While external circumstances can affect you, in the end, whether or not they control your life depends on you. Just like James Allen said, when you achieve self-mastery, no one (and no thing) will have the power to enslave you.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you blame an external factor for your lack of self-discipline, think again. Was it the person eating chocolate next to you who controlled what you put in your mouth, or was it you?</div>

<div id="calibre_link-297" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1199" class="class9">Day 6: On Superhumans</div>
<div class="class20">Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;Steve Jobs</span>
<span id="calibre_link-714"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-713" class="class23">6</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Despite an enormous selection of movies about superhumans, they don’t really exist. I know, it’s shocking news, right?</div>
<div class="class14">Nobody &mdash; including the world’s biggest geniuses &mdash; was, is, or ever will be a superhuman, infinitely better in all aspects than the average mortal.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s easy to forget this fact when you look at the accomplishments of the people who are changing the world around you. After all, they appear to be so perfect &mdash; extremely productive, intelligent, beautiful, creative, persistent, strong… and the list goes on.</div>
<div class="class14">Behind the scenes, everyone struggles in some areas of their lives.</div>
<div class="class14">I’m an author of several books about self-discipline, but it doesn’t mean that I never struggle with self-control. I deal with the same problems as every other person, and the only difference is that I’ve discovered how to handle some of them a bit more effectively. I’ve had my fair share of failures, found myself unable to resist some temptations, and I jeopardized some long-term goals because I succumbed to the allure of instant gratification<span id="calibre_link-1200"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">This is the human condition. People whom you consider to be extremely successful aren’t that different from you. Many of them in the past had less willpower than you exhibit now, and many of them might be more disciplined than you in one aspect, but less disciplined in another.</div>
<div class="class14">Becoming a self-disciplined person is within everybody’s grasp. You don’t need to have won the genetic lottery or get introduced to a country club to develop self-control &mdash; and neither you nor anybody else will ever achieve permanent, flawless self-mastery over every aspect of life. Accept that and accept yourself, as well.</div>
</div>


<div id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1201" class="class9">Day 7: On Poverty and Self-Discipline</div>
<div class="class20">A second line of research has shown that economic stress robs us of cognitive bandwidth. Worrying about bills, food or other problems, leaves less capacity to think ahead or to exert self-discipline. So, poverty imposes a mental tax.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Nicholas Kristof</span>
<span id="calibre_link-754"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-753" class="class23">7</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Financial stress (or for that matter, all kinds of stress) diminishes your ability to delay gratification. Consequently, poor people find it harder to resist temptations. In the end, they get stuck in a vicious cycle &mdash; they can’t escape poverty because it imposes constant mental stress on them, which then leads them to making bad decisions &mdash; not only the financial ones, but also those relating to their health, relationships, and general future.</div>
<div class="class14">Does it mean that if you’re struggling financially, you’re destined to have a bad life? Not necessarily. Taking personal responsibility and becoming conscious of the source of the problem can help you push ahead and overcome your circumstances.</div>
<div class="class14">Launching one of my businesses put me in debt. It exerted immense daily stress on me. No matter what I was doing, there was always the thought in the back of my head that I had a debt to repay. In some months, I was so close to not meeting my obligations on time that I would have been forced to close up shop if it weren’t for some money I managed to make at the last minute<span id="calibre_link-1202"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">This experience has made me realize that no matter what they say about money not bringing happiness, at least several months’ worth of income kept as savings in the bank means the difference between a relatively stress-free life and the soul-crushing fear when you can’t cover an urgent, important expense.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re struggling with finances, make it one of your priorities to get out of debt as quickly as you can and build an emergency fund covering at least three to six months of basic living expenses. In addition to improving your financial health, it will dramatically reduce stress and strengthen your ability to delay gratification and make more optimal choices favoring your future.</div>

<div class="class20">Epicurus wanted to examine the things he thought he needed so he could determine which of them he could in fact live without. He realized that in many cases, we work hard to obtain something because we are convinced that we would be miserable without it. The problem is that we can live perfectly well without some of these things, but we won’t know which they are if we don’t try living without them.</div>

<div class="class14">Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus would have his hands full in modern times if he wanted to spread his philosophy. We live in the world in which you feel you <span class="class11">deserve</span>
 to have luxuries. In fact, they’re no longer considered luxuries but necessities because most people mistakenly think they can’t live without them.</div>
<div class="class14">The problem with mistaking luxuries for necessities is that it’s impossible to develop powerful self-discipline if you <span class="class11">need</span>
 a lot just to function.</div>
<div class="class14">How is a person who believes that they <span class="class11">need</span>
 to eat empty calories in the form of burgers, pizzas, or white bread supposed to lose weight? How likely is that an individual who thinks that it’s <span class="class11">necessary</span>
 to lease a new car every two years will exert enough self-discipline to save money and “deprive” himself or herself of what they consider a basic human need?</div>
<div class="class14">Periodically try living without something that you consider a necessity. You’ll benefit in several ways<span id="calibre_link-1204"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">First, you’ll voluntarily put yourself in an uncomfortable situation that will help you expand your comfort zone and develop your mental resilience.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, you’ll discover whether you really <span class="class11">need</span>
 this thing in your life &mdash; and if you find you don’t, it will provide food for thought as to how many other things in your life are in fact not as important as you thought they were. This can then help you eliminate the unessential from your life and free up additional resources to focus on what’s important.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, you will increase your ability to feel happy with less &mdash; including being happy in a situation when you’re deprived of something involuntarily.</div>

<div class="class14">Studies suggest that people who are aided with technology to imagine their future selves are more likely to delay gratification. In the case of the cited study, they’re more likely to save money for retirement.</div>
<div class="class14">This shows that your self-discipline is largely affected by your ability to feel empathy toward your future self. If the vision of you ten, twenty, or thirty years from now isn’t particularly vivid, you’ll have a hard time denying yourself pleasure today so that the stranger in the future can benefit.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, consider occasionally meditating on your future self. Ask yourself if today you’re grateful for the choices you made several years ago, or if you wish that in the past you had been more concerned about your future. Are the choices you’re making today choices that are only benefiting the present “you,” but don’t contribute to &mdash; or worse, jeopardize &mdash; your well-being in the future?</div>
<div class="class14">The person you’ll become in ten years will most likely not be the same person you are today, but it will still be you &mdash; and it’s in your hands whether, ten years from now you’ll look back and feel glad <span id="calibre_link-1206"></span>
you extended self-empathy well into the future, or find that you decided to be selfish and steal from your future for some fleeting pleasure today.</div>

<div class="class14">Writing a novel is a daunting task if you’ve never written one before. It’s hard to write even a single paragraph, let alone write two or three hundred pages that will capture the attention of the reader and keep them reading until the last page. What’s worse, after all this effort, you’ll probably realize that your novel, when compared to a widely-acclaimed bestselling novel, is only good for kindling.</div>
<div class="class14">What you fail to see is that the author of that bestselling novel most likely has spent a decade or more mastering their craft. They started with words, which then became sentences, paragraphs, and eventually stories. Their first attempts &mdash; like those of everybody else &mdash; were unsuccessful. It took them hundreds of thousands of words’ worth of practice to finally write a masterpiece.</div>
<div class="class14">Building self-discipline is similar to writing a novel. You might consider a disciplined person who always wakes up at four in the morning, is physically active every day, eats a healthy diet, is super productive, and is capable of balancing it all with their social life and family obligations as a superhuman. But in reality, this person, like the bestselling novelist, probably started with one simple change and kept building on top of it.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you get discouraged, or feel tired by how far you still have to go to accomplish your goals, remind yourself that everybody <span id="calibre_link-1208"></span>
who has built self-discipline had to go through the same process &mdash; starting with little changes which then turned into habits, which then led to big lifestyle changes and identity shifts, and eventually, into successes.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1209" class="class9">Day 11: On Self-Discipline and Talent</div>
<div class="class20">Self-discipline without talent can often achieve astounding results, whereas talent without self-discipline inevitably dooms itself to failure.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-893" class="class23">11</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">When you look at some of the most successful high-performers, it might be tempting to say that they were born this way. They’re talented, end of story. In fact, talent &mdash; while undeniably makes life easier &mdash; is but one part of the equation.</div>
<div class="class14">I used to be a shy and fearful person. If you compared me, the awkward outsider, with the most successful guys at school, you could say they were born talented to be popular, liked and as alpha male as you could get, while I didn’t have such luck.</div>
<div class="class14">However, my apparent misfortune turned out to be a source of strength because it provided a spark to introduce big changes in my life. By continuously pushing my comfort zone, I not only overcame social shyness and improved my communication skills, but also developed high self-confidence and overcame other fears in my life.</div>
<div class="class14">I might not have been born with the talent to be a “people person” &mdash; I still prefer solitude to crowds &mdash; but with self-discipline and consistent work, I still achieved astounding results.</div>
<div class="class14">Next time, before you complain that you don’t have a talent for something or weren’t “born this way,” remind yourself that self-<span id="calibre_link-1210"></span>
discipline, in many situations, can more than make up for a lack of inborn traits.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1211" class="class9">Day 12: On Calmness of Mind</div>
<div class="class20">Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">If I asked you to show me a symbol of self-discipline, you might think of a Buddhist monk, capable of sitting still for hours on end with an empty mind and only a hint of a smile on his face, content simply to <span class="class11">be</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Such self-control feels like a superpower in today’s busy and fast-moving world, in which distractions lurk at every corner and buzz in every pocket. A person who’s capable of maintaining calmness of mind is a rare individual &mdash; but fortunately you can also become one, if you’re only willing to put in some effort.</div>
<div class="class14">Implementing some kind of a meditative practice in your weekly schedule will not only help you increase your self-control and develop more patience, but also reduce your stress and make you feel happier.</div>
<div class="class14">The most common practice to learn how to calm your mind is to meditate. However, meditation isn’t the only habit that puts you in a meditative state.</div>
<div class="class14">The key to developing everyday calmness is focusing your attention on the present moment or on a single activity that you’re performing. Engaging in a high-focus sport like yoga, rock climbing, <span id="calibre_link-1212"></span>
or boxing can be a good way to tap into this state &mdash; and so can be something as mundane as gardening, dancing, or knitting.</div>
<div class="class14">The more often you put yourself in a meditative state, the calmer you’ll become in everyday situations. Cultivating calmness will lead to even more self-control, and that will lead to an ever-heightening ability to control your state of mind and prevent emotions from clouding your judgment.</div>

<div class="class14">If you’re on a diet and decide to eat a piece of chocolate, you’re deciding that the instant fleeting pleasure is worth it more than your long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, one piece of chocolate doesn’t immediately translate to gaining weight, but it sets a precedent that (over the long term) <span class="class11">does</span>
 change your body in such a way that it reflects your preference for “what you want now,” not “what you want most.”</div>
<div class="class14">Each time you make a choice that favors instant gratification, your behavior signals that you have weak motivators. If your “reasons why” were strong enough, you’d be less likely to go with what you want <span class="class11">now</span>

<div class="class14">Imagine a straight line. On one end, there’s the satisfaction you get from what you want <span class="class11">now</span>
, and on the other end, there’s the satisfaction you’ll get from what you want <span class="class11">most</span>
. If the two ends are close to each other &mdash; meaning you only want what you want most <span class="class11">a little bit</span>
 more than what you want now &mdash; you’ll have a problem delaying gratification. If, on the other hand, the thing you want most is so much more rewarding than what you want now, you’ll have an easier time resisting the temptation<span id="calibre_link-1215"></span>

<div class="class14">To achieve your long-term goals, make sure that the satisfaction you get from what you want most is always much stronger than the satisfaction you can get from what you want now.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1216" class="class9">Day 14: On Long-Term Focus</div>
<div class="class20">In order to succeed, you must have a long-term focus. Most of the challenges in our lives come from a short-term focus.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Tony Robbins</span>
<span id="calibre_link-958"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-29" class="class23">13</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">I spent several long years starting one business after another, deluding myself that it was possible to build a six-figure business in a few months. Each time I failed to reach this goal, I closed one business and started working on another. Sometimes I worked on two or three ideas at the same time, thinking that one of them would surely succeed.</div>
<div class="class14">I would have saved myself a lot of time if I had realized that I had a short-term focus and this attitude had been the very reason why I couldn’t accomplish my goals. The moment I switched my mindset to that of being in it for the long haul, things started falling into place.</div>
<div class="class14">When I look back at my other goals, I struggled in a similar way due to the same reason.</div>
<div class="class14">In fitness, I wanted to build a well-defined physique as quickly as possible. I frequently reduced my daily caloric intake to levels that were impossible to maintain over the long term. In the end, I would have accomplished my goals more quickly by taking a more sustainable approach that would take me a year or two to reach my goal than fooling myself I could reach it in two or three months.</div>
<div class="class14">In learning languages, I wanted to learn new words as quickly as possible and soon found myself discouraged from looking at even <span id="calibre_link-1217"></span>
one more word. I wanted to learn a few dozen words a day, but in the end I would have accomplished more with a routine of learning just 5-10 words a day but maintained and used over years, not just weeks or months.</div>
<div class="class14">Analyze your goals and how you approach them. Replace short-term-oriented behaviors with those that show that you’re in it for the long haul. Self-discipline isn’t limited to rejecting a cake or sticking to an exercise habit; you also need self-discipline to maintain a long-term focus in all of your endeavors.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Just like knowledge, you can’t take self-discipline for granted. Unfortunately, being a self-disciplined person isn’t a “one and done” kind of thing. Once you have learned how to live that way, you can still lose it if you don’t consistently strengthen it by setting new challenges and rejecting instant gratification in favor of bigger future rewards.</div>
<div class="class14">Never assume that you’re “disciplined enough.” There’s always a new area in which you can improve your self-control and further expand your comfort zone.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, regular exercise poses no challenge for my self-discipline. In order to strengthen it, I need to set bigger and bigger exercise-related challenges for myself.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of focusing on fitness, I can also find a new area in which my discipline is lacking (such as developing more patience when dealing with other people) and focus on improving it until it’s no longer a test for my resolve.</div>
<div class="class14">Such consistent practice ensures that you’re at least <span class="class11">maintaining</span>
 your level of self-control, and ideally always getting better at it.<br class="calibre" />

<div class="class14">There’s no doubt that surrounding yourself with people who support your goals is helpful. It’s easier to exercise with a friend, diet along with your spouse, or belong to a community of frugal people.</div>
<div class="class14">However, as Marcus Aurelius says, you need to beware of relying too much on others.</div>
<div class="class14">If the only reason why you exercise is because you’re doing it with a friend, the moment they drop it, you’ll likely revert to the old ways, too.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re on a diet only because you want to lose weight to attract this beautiful friend of a friend, the moment you learn they’re in a relationship or aren’t interested in you, your self-control will be gone.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re productive at work only because you’re afraid of your boss, how likely will you be to exhibit productivity when they aren’t around?</div>
<div class="class14">Your motivators should always start with you and your own resolve to make changes. External support can be valuable, but just like a person recovering from an injury isn’t fully recovered if they can’t stand without a crutch, you aren’t self-disciplined enough unless you can still stick to your resolutions even without the help of other people.</div>

<div class="class14">No matter how self-disciplined you are, there’s no escaping the fact that sometimes you’ll stumble. Perhaps you’ll eat a piece of a cake instead of a salad. Maybe you’ll skip a workout out of laziness. It’s possible that when your efforts result in a failure, you’ll lose the self-discipline to continue and revert back to your old undesirable habits.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s all par for the course, and the sooner you accept, it, the easier it will be to handle the setbacks once they occur. However, don’t consider your failures a useless waste of time and energy; a failure can often present new opportunities or lead to important realizations.</div>
<div class="class14">I failed to learn how to play tennis despite putting considerable amount of time, energy, and money into it. However, this made me realize that I wanted to concentrate on rock climbing, and the failure with tennis cleared the way for dramatic improvements in my climbing performance.</div>

<div class="class14">I sometimes get flak for my goals. “You’re already slim. Why do you still watch your diet?” “Why do you save so much money? You should live it up!” “Can’t you live like a normal person, instead of waking up at 5 a.m. and going to sleep as early as 8 p.m.?”</div>
<div class="class14">By the standards of the person criticizing me, I should have stopped improving myself a long time ago. According to <span class="class11">my</span>
 standards, the growth should never end. I always hold myself responsible for a higher standard, and this allows me to maintain success-friendly habits in my life and achieve even more success.</div>
<div class="class14">If you allow yourself to have low standards, how are you supposed to ever achieve excellence? Exhibiting self-control is one of the most powerful demonstrations of having high standards; letting fleeting emotions and urges control your life &mdash; as most people do &mdash; is a sure-fire path to mediocrity.</div>

The only purpose of building self-discipline is to conquer yourself &mdash; your own urges, your own weaknesses, and your own self-sabotaging behaviors.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s easy to forget this fact and assume that when you reach your goals you’re done. In fact, the moment you make your dreams come true isn’t the most important moment. It’s important, no doubt, but without the process leading to it, in itself it means little.</div>
<div class="class14">The most important moments are the moments of struggle, when you’re striving to fight even when you can barely stand and the whole world is spinning around you. It’s this very act that proves your mettle and showers you with life-encompassing benefits, not the act of winning in itself.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you find yourself frustrated that you’re still a long way from the finish line, remember that it’s right now, at this very moment, that you’re collecting the biggest rewards. It’s the struggle in itself that improves you and makes you a more successful person.</div>

<div class="class14">Epictetus suggests a simple exercise of not complaining when you feel unwell. To make the first step even easier, he says that you don’t even have to immediately stop complaining at all &mdash; just stop complaining “with your whole being.”</div>
<div class="class14">Could you do it just for today? Once you successfully go one day without complaining with your whole being, how about two days? Three days? A week? A month? Could you then add other little challenges and consistently strengthen your willpower?</div>
<div class="class14">Other simple practices you can implement to begin building more self-discipline include:</div>
<div class="class14">- Resisting the temptation to yell in anger when another driver does something that irks you.</div>
<div class="class14">- Eating just slightly less than you’d like to eat, like one square of a chocolate or one potato chip less.</div>

<div class="class14">Habits are like magical powers. The moment they kick in, you no longer need more than perhaps a modicum of self-discipline every now and then to continue performing the same action on a regular basis. What originally was extremely difficult to do is now something you largely do automatically, with little thought or willpower.</div>
<div class="class14">When something becomes a part of your routine, resistance drops to nearly zero. The challenging part is forming a new habit. Research suggests that it takes anywhere from 18 to 254 days<span id="calibre_link-44"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-43" class="class25">21</a>
 to form a new habit, with 66 days being the average time (not 21 days, as the common knowledge goes).</div>
<div class="class14">When working on your goals, remind yourself that it’s the first months that will be the hardest. Once the proper habits kick in, things will get easier.</div>
<div class="class14">Remember that in the long term, only habits &mdash; and their subsequent permanent changes in lifestyle and identity&mdash; can ensure lasting success. Consequently, it’s key to think in terms of lifelong routines<span id="calibre_link-1229"></span>

<div class="class14">As long as you’re jumping from one two-week diet to another instead of establishing new nutritional habits, you’re destined to regain weight. As long as you’re switching between different six-week workout programs to lose some weight &mdash; and not thinking of exercise as a permanent part of your weekly routine &mdash; sooner or later, you’ll revert to inactivity.</div>
<div class="class14">Analyze your goals and assess whether your plans employ self-discipline to help you build a habit or if you’re using self-control as a means of <span class="class11">temporarily</span>

<div class="class20">Self-discipline is a form of freedom. Freedom from laziness and lethargy, freedom from the expectations and demands of others, freedom from weakness and fear or doubt.

<div class="class14">On the other hand, a person who thinks of self-discipline as a form of freedom will welcome opportunities to practice his or her self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">When facing temptations and fighting hard to not let them enslave you, remember that through letting go of them, you aren’t losing anything substantial; the freedom to be a master of your thoughts and emotions is ultimately worth more than any temporary gratification, of which you’re depriving yourself.</div>

After all, why think about what the provided news really means or whether it’s even true in the first place? It’s the job of the newspaper or news site, isn’t it?</div>
<div class="class14">Take advantage of the opportunity to improve your self-discipline by exposing yourself to other points of view and thinking for yourself. It takes work and questioning your beliefs is uncomfortable, which results in a great exercise for your self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">Another risk lies in defaulting to easy entertainment or avoiding difficult topics. While there’s nothing wrong in reading easy books to relax, you miss out if you stay away from more demanding and complex works.</div>
<div class="class14">Reading thought-provoking and/or long titles conditions your brain to eschew mental laziness. When a book provides an intellectual challenge and you keep going, you train yourself to stay with problems for as long as necessary to figure them out instead of <span id="calibre_link-1232"></span>
giving up &mdash; and that’s a habit that will surely help you in other endeavors, too.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1233" class="class9">Day 24: On Happiness Through Self-Discipline</div>
<div class="class20">It is one of the strange ironies of this strange life that those who work the hardest, who subject themselves to the strictest discipline, who give up certain pleasurable things in order to achieve a goal, are the happiest. When you see 20 or 30 people line up for a distance race in some meet, don’t pity them, don’t feel sorry for them. Better envy them instead.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Bruce Hamilton</div>
<div class="class14">For a person who has never tested their self-discipline over a long period of time, it’s hard to believe that giving up pleasure can lead to immense happiness. Most certainly, it doesn’t feel that way when you’re fighting against the craving for chocolate, compare exercise to torture, or feel sad that you have to set money aside and can’t spend it on this new cool gadget.</div>
<div class="class14">However, in the long haul, based on my personal experience, subjecting yourself to a strict discipline <span class="class11">does</span>
 lead to a happier life &mdash; and it can be a powerful motivator in the moments of doubt.</div>
<div class="class14">Let me explain why…</div>
<div class="class14">Firstly, as we talked about in Day 1, living your life the hard way makes it easier. People who voluntarily expose themselves to challenges are more capable of handling unforeseen hardships.</div>
<div class="class14">Moreover, giving up certain pleasures (such as unhealthy food and sitting all day in front of the TV) can lead to immense improvements in one’s well-being. Maintaining a healthy weight and <span id="calibre_link-1234"></span>
beneficial nutritional habits doesn’t just lead to physical improvements; it also affects self-esteem, reduces the risk for depression, and improves your body image<span id="calibre_link-219"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-218" class="class25">24</a>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Giving up on pleasurable things (such as spending money without control) can also help you avoid crushing problems in the future. Today it might be inconvenient that you can’t spend your entire salary, but tomorrow your savings can save you from bankruptcy or pay for an urgent medical intervention.</div>
<div class="class14">Lastly, self-discipline is in itself a manifestation of your higher being, and is connected with nobler strivings. A human being, reduced to its primal form, has little ability for self-control. Operating in “scarcity mode” and left to its own devices, your primal brain will stuff your body until you won’t be able to walk. It will make you cheat on your partner with every passing stranger. It will assume that every step outside the comfort zone is a danger, and so you’ll never grow.</div>
<div class="class14">Exerting self-control is working against the dominance of your primal brain. You forego primal urges in order to reach bigger and more important goals or to cultivate values that are important to you. You can live your life in a way that is congruent with who you are as a deeply complex human being, not a mere animal with the ability to reason. This leads to experiencing a wide variety of experiences that life has to offer; many of them are immensely more gratifying than merely satisfying the most basic human needs.</div>

<div class="class20">Whenever you are presented with a choice, ask yourself which option you would prefer to have taken in ten years.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-281"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-280" class="class23">25</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Self-discipline is largely dependent on your ability to look into the future and imagine yourself not having taken the difficult choice today. If you paint the mental picture with enough detail, you won’t be able to bear the thought of letting the situation remain the same or getting worse.</div>
<div class="class14">A simple exercise of asking yourself which option you would prefer to have taken in ten years can help you avoid succumbing to temptations. And let’s not fool ourselves &mdash; it probably won’t work every time, but even if it doesn’t work every time, at least it will make you pause <span class="class11">sometimes</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s imagine that you’re torn between buying a new piece of furniture you don’t really need but like a lot, or saving that money for your retirement. In ten years, would you rather have a crumbling piece of furniture you rarely use or &mdash; thanks to the power of compounding &mdash; twice the amount you’re now pondering on spending?</div>
<div class="class14">For this technique to work, you need to consider your failure to stick to your resolutions not as a once-off event, but a precedent that <span id="calibre_link-1237"></span>
can ruin your long-term progress. Otherwise this technique won’t work.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re on a diet and are tempted to eat this awesome chocolate chip cookie, if you tell yourself that it’s simply this one time, obviously in a ten-year timeframe it means nothing. And it’s true &mdash; one cookie eaten today won’t ruin your diet for the next decade.</div>
<div class="class14">However, it’s not about eating this specific cookie. It’s about the precedent it sets and a possible pattern of cheating during a diet that might develop from making this decision. In ten years, would you prefer to have developed a habit of eating cookies while on a diet or established a habit of <span class="class11">not</span>
 eating cookies at all, or only on special occasions?<br class="calibre" />

Granted, not everyone has the health required for strenuous physical activity, but there’s always some kind of effort you can undertake to move your body in a beneficial way.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to obvious health benefits, physical activity provides another immense benefit: it’s an exercise in exposing yourself to effort and challenge for the sake of bettering yourself.

</div>
<div class="class14">A frequently overlooked aspect of building self-discipline is the fact that if you want to rise above mediocrity, you need to be fine with the fact that you’ll undoubtedly make a fool of yourself every now and then.</div>
<div class="class14">Perhaps you tell all of your friends that you’re going to build a business, but the business goes bankrupt and you lose all of your savings.</div>
<div class="class14">Maybe you set a goal to harness the power of your self-discipline to learn public speaking (even though you’re terrified of standing in front of the crowds), and then deliver a less than stellar performance.</div>
<div class="class14">This is normal &mdash; you have to fail your way to the success &mdash; but for many people, it’s a blow they can’t withstand. They might be so harmed by it that they’ll do <span class="class11">anything</span>

<div class="class14">Failure, rejection, and humiliation are anything but pleasant. However, the ability to withstand it and keep going is one of the key differences between successful individuals and those who fail to make their dreams come true.</div>
<div class="class14">As disagreeable as it can be, accept that occasionally looking like a fool as a part of the process of becoming a successful person. <span id="calibre_link-1248"></span>

”</div>
<div class="class20">To be “normal” is the ideal aim for the unsuccessful, for all those who are still below the general level of adaptation. But for people of more than average ability, people who never found it difficult to gain successes and to accomplish their share of the world’s work &mdash; for them the moral compulsion to be nothing but normal signifies the bed of Procrustes &mdash; deadly and insupportable boredom, a hell of sterility and hopelessness.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-819"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-818" class="class23">30</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">There’s nothing “normal” in building self-discipline. Most people avoid all kinds of discomfort and effort. They don’t want to experience personal growth because it interferes with them stuffing themselves with French fries, wasting countless hours in front of TV, spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need, lollygagging at work, and cutting corners whenever they can.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to join the minority of people who <span class="class11">do</span>
 possess self-control and strive to strengthen it even further, you’ll be considered weird. This means that you need to prepare yourself for potential ridicule, being frowned upon, and not being understood.</div>
<div class="class14">It might be hard at first to face so much adversity when all you want to do is to improve yourself. To overcome this situation, get the following fact at the forefront of your mind: “normal” is the ideal for the mediocre, “exceptional” (or, in the words of the unsuccessful, “weird”) is the ideal for the high-achievers and trailblazers.</div>
<div class="class14">Every time you feel out of sync with the rest of the world, remember that there <span class="class11">are</span>
 other people like you. During the <span id="calibre_link-1251"></span>
challenging times, when’re you’re stumbling, remind yourself that even when you’re failing, you’re still forging your own path, something that the vast majority of people will never do.

</div>
<div class="class14">If self-discipline were like a mushroom that springs up of itself without the need for a gardener, everybody would possess it. Unfortunately &mdash; or fortunately, depending on how you look at it &mdash; it’s more like a plant that you need to constantly cultivate, or else it withers.</div>
<div class="class14">Some people believe that one either possesses a “green thumb” or not &mdash; as if one person were born with an inborn talent to care for plants and another not.</div>
<div class="class14">In reality, the person with the supposed green thumb is simply more attentive to their plants. They make sure their plants have everything they need to thrive and regularly check up on them to make sure they stay healthy.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of self-discipline in the same way. You plant its seeds the moment you decide it’s time to stop coasting through life and prioritize long-term rewards over instant gratification. However, this moment is just the very beginning; as in the case of planting the seed for a new flowering plant, there’s a lot of time and energy you’ll still <span id="calibre_link-1253"></span>
need to invest to make it bloom. If you want to have a beautiful plant, you can’t water it occasionally or move it from one place to another every other week.</div>
<div class="class14">Ask yourself: what kind of a gardener am I for my own self-discipline? If your self-control were a plant, how would it look based on how you’ve been cultivating it the past years?</div>

<div class="class14">Patience and self-discipline are close cousins. If you want to reject instant gratification for the sake of accomplishing your long-term goals, it might take months or years before you receive your big compensation. Without patience, you’ll get nowhere.</div>
<div class="class14">While sometimes you can force results to come more quickly &mdash; by pushing yourself harder and being as diligent as you can during the process&mdash; oftentimes things take time and there’s no way to rush them, no matter how many resources you apply.</div>
<div class="class14">Like pregnancy, some things follow a natural schedule you can’t control. If you fail to identify which things cannot be rushed, you might misapply the power of self-discipline and instead of achieving them more quickly, fail to achieve them at all.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, a body has a natural limit of how much body fat it can burn during a week without breaking down your muscle. If you try to rush the process by starving yourself, the most likely end result is an unplanned cheat week that will not only take you back to square one, but most likely add some additional body fat to your frame<span id="calibre_link-1256"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Even with things that are difficult to measure, such as learning to control your mind so that you can eventually radiate optimism, you can’t force yourself to change overnight. Rewiring your brain takes time, and it doesn’t matter how much time you spend meditating or reading books about emotional control; a process that is so profound takes time.</div>
<div class="class14">Generally speaking, if it has taken you years or decades to develop a negative trait, don’t expect that you can reverse it within weeks or months. Approach such undertakings with the belief that you’ll do your best, but that you won’t get discouraged or frustrated if the process is slow. It would be as futile as a woman complaining that pregnancy lasts nine months.</div>

<div class="class14">It’s tempting to believe that, after enough time passes, suddenly you’ll attain enlightenment and acquire permanent, unbreakable self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">In reality, there’s no sudden awakening that will happen if you deny temptations for long enough. Just like today you’re consciously choosing to reject a chocolate bar so you can enjoy an attractive physique a year from now, a year from now you will still need to reject a chocolate bar to maintain the body you attained.</div>
<div class="class14">There are no secret powers that self-disciplined people have somehow attained that give them magical powers to resist temptations.</div>
<div class="class14">Despite having built a healthy, fit physique, I still fight &mdash; and sometimes fail &mdash; to overcome temptations. I still need to make sure my plates are full of satiating, healthy foods so that I don’t fill them later on with something less than healthy, yet again. I still need to monitor how much I eat and avoid places where I’m likely to overeat. I still do full-day fasts every now and then to practice self-control that is associated with hunger.</div>
<div class="class14">No matter the challenge, I still mostly use the same strategies I’d been using prior to accomplishing my goals. The actions don’t change. What changes is the person performing them<span id="calibre_link-1259"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, rejecting chocolate today may feel like the greatest punishment in the world. A year from now, rejecting chocolate is simply a fact of life: you want to stay in top shape, so you don’t stuff yourself with chocolate on a daily basis.</div>
<div class="class14">It will still require self-control, but as long as you diligently exercise your willpower muscle, the temptation will most likely be easier to overcome. And in the end, that’s what building self-discipline gives you: an easier life, through voluntarily choosing to live it the hard way.</div>

<div class="class14">To avoid procrastination at work, I use a rule I like to call “the zero-second rule”: the moment I realize that I’m wasting my time to avoid work, I <span class="class11">immediately</span>
 stop whatever unproductive thing I’m doing and start working.</div>
<div class="class14">If I let myself ponder whether I want to start working or not, my resistance will only grow, and soon, it will be so difficult to overcome that I may fail to accomplish anything productive for the rest of the day.</div>
<div class="class14">This trick works because (like Leonardo da Vinci said) resistance is greatest at the beginning. Once you start performing an unpleasant task and gain some momentum, it’s easier to stick to the task than to give up and return to procrastination.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you catch yourself putting off something unpleasant, act right away and deal with it now. The sooner you act, the sooner you’ll be done with it.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I always wash the cookware I used to cook my dinner before I eat my meal. This way I can eat my dinner without the unpleasant thought in the back of my mind that I’ll not only have to wash the dishes, but also the pots and pans I used for cooking.</div>
<div class="class14">Small habits like that can help establish a habit of choosing to do the hard things now instead of letting all the hard tasks accumulate like a backlog at work. When you adopt this habit, you’ll greatly <span id="calibre_link-1265"></span>
reduce the impact of procrastination on your life &mdash; and enjoy more tranquility to boot!</div>

<div class="class20">Monks, these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life. What are the two? There is addiction to indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy, and unprofitable. Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and to Nibbana.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">When you set firm resolutions to improve yourself, you might be tempted to push your limits well outside of what you’re capable of doing. Ambitiousness is a virtue, but there’s danger involved in going from one extreme to another.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently struggling to be productive, don’t force yourself to work sixteen hours a day. If you’re struggling to control your appetite, don’t impose a week-long fast. If you can’t find it in you to choose the stairs over the elevator, don’t expect that you’ll maintain a workout plan that requires you to work out every single day.</div>
<div class="class14">Find the middle path, stick to it for at least several weeks, and then, based on the results you get, decide whether you can further stretch your limits or require more time before advancing.</div>
<div class="class14">As much as I believe in pushing your boundaries and exploring the extremes, you don’t need to put yourself through mortification to <span id="calibre_link-1267"></span>
achieve good results. Subjecting yourself to extreme hardships has some merits, but over the long term it’s unsustainable, if not downright dangerous.</div>
<div class="class14">Remember that there should be moderation in all things, including moderation itself. Sometimes a more extreme approach is needed for a short period of time, and sometimes it’s beneficial to set your goals lower. In whatever you do, seek to not spend too much time loafing around, but also make sure that your life hasn’t turned into the life of a self-flagellating ascetic.</div>

<div class="class14">Some people use moderation as an excuse to not do their best, often mistaking mediocrity for moderation.</div>
<div class="class14">“Let’s call it a day. I’ve already worked five minutes more than yesterday. You gotta stay in balance.”</div>
<div class="class14">“Let’s stick with the same weight for the next five workouts, even though I can easily lift it. Moderation is key.”</div>
<div class="class14">“I’ve already gone down two sizes. I guess I’m still a bit overweight, but let’s not forget that going to the extreme is a bad thing.”</div>
<div class="class14">If you use moderation as an excuse not to push your limits, you’re mistaking moderation with mediocrity. If you’re trying to lift a weight that you can barely lift off the floor, some moderation will be good for you. If you’re lifting it like it’s a feather and telling yourself you’re still doing great because at least you’re exercising, you’re letting mediocrity limit your growth.</div>
<div class="class14">Sticking to easy things that are well within your grasp isn’t moderation<span id="calibre_link-1269"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Equating mediocrity with moderation largely comes down to having low standards. A person who thinks that exercising once a week is incredible because most of his friends only exercise with a TV remote will most likely stop challenging themselves well before it would be wise to remember about moderation.</div>
<div class="class14">That’s not to say that you should compare yourself to other people; compare yourself to yourself from the past. If today (a year since you started to exercise) you’re still performing the same exercises with little to no improvement, perhaps you’ve confused moderation with self-congratulation.</div>
<div class="class14">Moreover (as we’ve already covered when talking about moderation as a good thing), you should also apply moderation to moderation itself. It’s impossible to always follow the middle path.</div>
<div class="class14">Sometimes you’ll zig and sometimes you’ll zag. One day might spend 12 hours working on an important project so that you can spend the entire next day with your family. There’s nothing unbalanced in it, as long as you move from an extreme in one thing (like work) to an extreme in another (like family), without staying too long in either one.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1270" class="class9">Day 40: On Talking vs. Doing</div>
<div class="class20">It is better to practice a little than talk a lot.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;A Zen saying, attributed to Muso Soseki</div>
<div class="class14">Announcing to all of your friends, family members, and colleagues that you’re going to change and going deep into details how you’re going to do it is useless at best and sabotaging at worst.</div>
<div class="class14">Firstly, not everyone will be happy to hear that you want to improve yourself because it will make it painfully obvious that they’re lazy or don’t have as much courage as you do. Instead of support, you can receive criticism that might make you less likely to act upon your dreams.</div>
<div class="class14">Secondly, research suggests that announcing your plans makes you less motivated to accomplish them.<span id="calibre_link-1080"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-707" class="class25">38</a>
 By talking about your plans, you get the erroneous satisfaction that you’ve already taken action to change yourself and consequently, you’re less likely to take real action.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to tell your friends about your new goal, choose a person whom you know will support you. In addition, instead of telling them in a self-congratulatory way that you’re finally going to achieve your dreams, ask them to hold you accountable if you don’t honor your resolution.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Never take self-discipline for granted or assume that if you can control your urges, you’re now invincible.</div>
<div class="class14">Humility plays an important role in helping you maintain self-control. An arrogant person will be more likely to unnecessarily test their willpower, which will eventually lead to their downfall. This happens because of the restraint bias &mdash; the tendency for people to overestimate how capable they are of controlling impulsive behaviors.</div>
<div class="class14">Research shows that people who had an inflated belief in their self-control overexposed themselves to temptations, such as recovering smokers putting themselves in situations tempting them to smoke, which increased the risk of a relapse.<span id="calibre_link-1137"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-751" class="class25">40</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Assume that your self-discipline is like prosperity. It’s possible that it will stay with you for a long time, but it’s also possible that it will disappear. Consequently, you’ll work harder to keep it in your life. If it does go away when you make some mistakes, you’ll accept it with more tranquility and be more likely to regain it quickly.</div>

<div class="class14">Reading hundreds of books, blog posts, articles, and watching countless videos on self-discipline isn’t going to automatically reprogram your brain so that one day you’ll wake up with the self-control of a samurai.</div>
<div class="class14">The intention behind this book is to offer you quick, interesting tidbits related to self-discipline that you can easily act upon. No matter how detailed my writings are, you’ll always learn more by taking one little action than by reading ten of my books or re-reading the same book over and over again.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I can <span class="class11">tell</span>
 you that the greatest amount of willpower is needed during the first few minutes of an uncomfortable task, such as taking a cold shower. Once a couple of minutes pass, your body will adapt to the challenge and it gets easier to handle.</div>
<div class="class14">But that’s just me talking. Go and actually take an ice-cold shower. <span class="class11">Experience</span>
 the wild emotions, start shivering, <span class="class11">feel</span>
 the overpowering temptation to turn on hot water, and wonder if you can last even a second longer, and then &mdash; two or three minutes later &mdash; feel your body start to relax, with the ice-cold water no longer feeling like the worst torture in the world. Then step out the shower feeling, elated that you managed to overcome your weakness of will<span id="calibre_link-1274"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you face an uncomfortable situation, tap into your real-world experience &mdash; not mere words read in a book &mdash; to realize that, just like with an ice-cold shower, you can adapt to this situation, as well.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-332" class="class19">Day 43: On Making Continuous Efforts</div>
<div class="class20">Genius is often only the power of making continuous efforts. The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it &mdash; so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it. How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience, would have achieved success. As the tide goes clear out, so it comes clear in. In business sometimes prospects may seem darkest when really they are on the turn. A little more persistence, a little more effort, and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success. There is no failure except in no longer trying. There is no defeat except from within, no really insurmountable barrier save our own inherent weakness of purpose.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">I’m an avid rock climber. In rock climbing, particularly when climbing long routes, your forearms can get pumped to such an extent that you can no longer hold onto the rock. Climbers afraid of failing will often ask their belayer to take in the rope so that they can rest and try again with renewed strength.</div>
<div class="class14">While this strategy is good for learning how to climb a difficult route, sometimes it costs a climber an on-sight (a clean ascent with no prior practice of the route) or a redpoint (completing a route without resting on the rope) because they give up too quickly, right after they start feeling overpowering discomfort<span id="calibre_link-1276"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Even when you can barely hold onto the wall, often you can still perform one or two moves more &mdash; and those moves may be enough to upgrade your position to a rest stance where you can safely recharge and continue climbing without resting on the rope.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s the same with many other areas of life. You believe that you can’t go on any longer, that your self-discipline has run out and it’s time to throw up your hands in defeat, while in reality, persisting just a little bit longer is all that separates you from success.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you feel like giving up, persuade yourself to push a little bit longer. Chances are, success is right around the corner.</div>

<div class="class14">A positive attitude is essential if you want to build self-discipline. What’s the point of denying yourself instant gratification if you don’t believe that you’ll get a greater compensation for it in the future?</div>
<div class="class14">If you suffer from pessimism, realize that along with improving your self-control, you’ll need to improve your ability to see the world in brighter colors. Three easy steps you can take today to become more optimistic include:</div>
<div class="class14">1. Express gratitude for what you already have. If you can’t be happy with what you have today, you won’t be happy with what you have tomorrow.</div>
<div class="class14">2. Reframe negative events into opportunities and lessons. An event is bad for you only if you decide it is. Think of it as a lesson or an opportunity to change your life, in order to give it a positive meaning.</div>
<div class="class14">3. Surround yourself with positive input. If you only read fear-mongering news and hang out with pessimistic grumblers, you’ll have a hard time exhibiting optimism.</div>

<div class="class14">For many people, one of the hardest challenges for their self-discipline is the resolution to stop lying. We constantly encounter opportunities to lie, wherever we go and whatever we do. It seems it’s even socially permissible to lie a little, whether by telling a white lie, making yourself look better on a resume, or tweaking your height, weight, and financial situation on online dating sites.</div>
<div class="class14">As the old saying goes, honesty is the best policy &mdash; and it’s also one of the best ways to strengthen your character. It’s one thing to deny yourself a piece of cake, and it’s a completely different thing to tell the truth when you think it will make you look bad or threaten the relationship you have with someone. Yet, over the long-term, the truth always emerges &mdash; and if not, it still eats away at your conscience, so why postpone the discomfort you’ll eventually feel anyway?</div>
<div class="class14">Vow to tell the truth no matter the circumstances (except for extreme situations, such as your life being in danger).</div>
<div class="class14">Please note that being honest doesn’t mean that you need to share everything about yourself with other people. that Telling them, “I don’t feel like answering that question” (without giving any justifications &mdash; it’s your right to not explain any of your decisions) <span id="calibre_link-1281"></span>
is a simple way to remain honest when a person asks you a question you’d normally answer with a lie.</div>

<div class="class14">Self-discipline is a lot like dealing with fear. When you face temptations, look them straight in the eye and send them packing, the next time they appear in your life, you’ll be able to say to yourself, “I managed to overcome them once. I can handle them this time as well.”</div>
<div class="class14">The more times you successfully overcome the temptations, the easier it will be to handle them again. Regular practice will make you less susceptible to temptations and even more likely to ignore them, just like looking fear in the face will make you more likely to act in spite of it.</div>
<div class="class14">Granted, it’s not that with enough experience, you’ll become unconditionally self-disciplined, just like you won’t one day stop being afraid of anything. Just remember that each situation that tests your resolve is another experience from which you can draw inspiration to overcome future challenging circumstances when they occur.</div>

It’s a better investment to fix your sagging cheeks than to learn how to exercise restraint in unnecessary spending. Nobody will comment or even notice your deterioration of mental toughness and a growing preference for complacency over growth, but everybody will praise you for your new clothes. $10 for a book that can change your life is too expensive. $100 for another pair of jeans is a screaming deal.</div>

<div class="class14">My relationship with food is often criticized by other people. If I don’t stuff my face with food every three hours, then surely I’ve developed an eating disorder. The norm is to eat often, and if your behavior differs from it, you’re weird. However, I do what I consider to be best for me, and I refuse to follow different eating habits merely because it’s the most common way of doing things.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s difficult to trust your own judgment when everybody around you is doing something different, but if everything you do is in accordance with society’s norms, then what you’re going to get is the same results as everybody else does who follows those norms.</div>

<div class="class20">You have to decide what your highest priorities are and have the courage &mdash; pleasantly, smilingly, non-apologetically &mdash; to say “no” to other things. And the way to do that is by having a bigger “yes” burning inside.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Stephen Covey</div>
<div class="class14">Without the bigger “yes” burning inside of you, there’s no way you’ll continue making the uncomfortable choices over the long term for the sake of your goal.</div>
<div class="class14">The primary reason why I stuck to entrepreneurship, despite countless failures, was my intention to help my parents build a house in the countryside. It was their dream, and by extension, <span class="class11">my</span>
 dream.</div>
<div class="class14">This big “yes” had been burning inside me no matter what was happening with my business. Even after another big defeat, I still knew that I would never “lay down my arms” in the fight to become able to give them their dream. If you have such a strong “yes” inside you, you’ll also refuse to surrender the fight to achieve <span class="class11">your</span>
 dream.</div>
<div class="class14">Your burning “yes” will also help you pinpoint your priorities and disregard distractions. For example, if you decided to save money for the future education of your child, saying “no” to spending money on things you’d like to have (but don’t need) would be much easier than without such a powerful motivator. You would be focused on the long-view of where you wanted to be when your child was older<span id="calibre_link-1296"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If your biggest dream in life is to become a surgeon, you won’t feel apprehensive about declining an invitation for a party because you want to prepare yourself for an important exam. The “yes” burning inside you would be stronger than the fear of missing out on a few hours spent drinking with your friends.</div>
<div class="class14">Granted, as we’ve already discussed, there should be some balance in everything, but generally speaking, you’ll do well if you can discover a burning reason why you want to accomplish a given dream and unapologetically say no to anything that might threaten your chances of making it come true.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Bill Gates’ quote refers to the evolution of personal computing, but the world of self-discipline isn’t any different.</div>
<div class="class14">A staggering number of people give up on their goals just weeks or months into them, discouraged that they <span class="class11">still</span>
 haven’t reached their goals or that their results are lackluster.</div>
<div class="class14">Sorry to have to break it to you, but the world doesn’t work that way. With few exceptions, nobody can build a successful business in six months, achieve a perfect physique in three months, learn a new language in four weeks, or become a self-disciplined person overnight.</div>
<div class="class14">However, the sky is the limit for those who are in it for the long haul. Ten years of dedicated practice can turn anyone into a world-class expert. When you gain momentum, you’ll get exponential results. The trick is to stick to your goals long enough for the velocity to accrue.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, in the first year you might only get your business off the ground, but in its third or fourth year it can explode virtually overnight. What actually happens is not an overnight success, but a <span id="calibre_link-1299"></span>
process that took place over several years, during which it built upon itself in an exponential way.</div>
<div class="class14">When you look at my catalog of books, you might be tempted to say that I succeeded right away. “Martin’s first book became a bestseller, so it’s possible to become a bestselling author in a few months.”</div>
<div class="class14">That would be a great example of overestimating what you can achieve in a short period of time. My first book wasn’t actually my first book. I’d been writing &mdash; articles, blog posts, books, etc. &mdash; for a long time before I started writing about self-discipline. It was a process of well over ten years that resulted in my becoming a bestselling author.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever setting a new goal, take the long-term approach. Unlike the person who assumes that their world can change overnight, be in it for the long haul, and the short-term fluctuations won’t make you give up.</div>

<div class="class14">Hardships are a part of life and while nobody (with the exception of masochists) enjoys pain, they can be valuable because they present an opportunity for personal growth.</div>
<div class="class14">I like to say that you discover how deep your self-discipline goes when you struggle, and not when everything goes well.</div>
<div class="class14">You aren’t self-disciplined because you worked hard when you were fired up to work. You’re self-disciplined when you <span class="class11">continue</span>
 to work hard when the last thing you want to do is work.</div>
<div class="class14">You aren’t self-disciplined because you can’t afford candy, so you don’t eat it. You exhibit self-control when you deny the treats that are offered freely to you, for example when you’re at a party with a buffet selection of high-calorie snacks.</div>
<div class="class14">You aren’t self-disciplined when you wake up early in the morning to work on your new business. You’re self-disciplined when you <span class="class11">still</span>

<div id="calibre_link-345" class="class19">Day 57: On Two Types of Happiness</div>
<div class="class20">People who have high levels of what is known as eudaimonic well-being &mdash; the kind of happiness that comes from having a deep sense of purpose and meaning in life (think Mother Teresa) &mdash; showed very favorable gene-expression profiles in their immune cells. They had low levels of inflammatory gene expression and strong expression of antiviral and antibody genes.</div>
<div class="class26">However, people who had relatively high levels of hedonic well-being &mdash; the type of happiness that comes from consummatory self-gratification (think most celebrities) &mdash; actually showed just the opposite. They had an adverse expression profile involving high inflammation and low antiviral and antibody gene expression.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Mark Wheeler</span>
<span id="calibre_link-868"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-148" class="class23">54</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Science suggests that the fleeting happiness you get from succumbing to a temptation is inferior &mdash; at least when it comes to its effect on how your genes express &mdash; to the type of happiness you can draw out of a sense of purpose and meaning in life.</div>
<div class="class14">According to the study, a person guided by a deep sense of purpose is less likely to suffer from inflammation and more likely to have a stronger immune system. While both types of happiness can generate the same positive emotions, it’s those with high levels of eudaimonic well-being that benefit more<span id="calibre_link-1306"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Since the results come from a study on just 80 participants, we shouldn’t treat the conclusions as a broadly-applicable scientific fact. However, there’s definitely immense power in having a mission in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">When all of your decisions are aligned toward a better future (even if you’re suffering at times because things don’t go as planned or it’s hard to maintain self-discipline), you wake up fired up, with vigor and a sense of purpose you’d never get if you were to prioritize hedonic well-being.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1307" class="class9">Day 58: On Cultivating Physical Excellence</div>
<div class="class20">For in everything that men do the body is useful; and in all uses of the body it is of great importance to be in as high a state of physical efficiency as possible.</div>
<div class="class26">Why, even in the process of thinking, in which the use of the body seems to be reduced to a minimum, it is matter of common knowledge that grave mistakes may often be traced to bad health. And because the body is in a bad condition, loss of memory, depression, discontent, insanity often assail the mind so violently as to drive whatever knowledge it contains clean out of it.</div>
<div class="class26">But a sound and healthy body is a strong protection to a man, and at least there is no danger then of such a calamity happening to him through physical weakness: on the contrary, it is likely that his sound condition will serve to produce effects the opposite of those that arise from bad condition. And surely a man of sense would submit to anything to obtain the effects that are the opposite of those mentioned in my list.</div>
<div class="class26">Besides, it is a disgrace to grow old through sheer carelessness before seeing what manner of man you may become by developing your bodily strength and beauty to their highest limit.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Socrates</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1035"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-210" class="class23">55</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Socrates points out that there are several dangers in not cultivating physical excellence.</div>
<div class="class14">First, an unhealthy body leads to an unhealthy mind. Can a person suffering from preventable health disorders dedicate all of their resources toward personal growth? Physical debilitations that you can overcome with your own efforts (such as obesity or a weak <span id="calibre_link-1308"></span>
immune system due to bad nutritional habits) sap your energy and limit your potential.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re constantly getting sick, how likely are you to maintain self-discipline? I don’t know about you, but whenever I get so sick that I can barely walk around the house, my routine is out of the window and it takes a considerable amount of time to return to it. The more often you get sick, the more difficult it is to build new habits and maintain successful routines.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, a strong body is better prepared &mdash; both physically and mentally &mdash; to deal with any health problems that you can’t prevent. Consequently, you can more quickly recover from those hardships (or accept them with more ease) and refocus your efforts on your most important long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">Last but most definitely not least, developing your body to your own highest limit (which doesn’t mean becoming a muscle head or having a perfectly sculpted body) is a valuable goal in itself. It shows you how much you can push your limits, teaches you how powerful long-term dedication can be, and can transform your entire mindset. In fact, just cultivating physical excellence on its own can develop powerful self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">I can attest to these benefits. When I started exercising and my body began to change, I soon saw my mental state reflect the positive external changes. A great amount of the experience I have had with overcoming temptations and sticking to my resolutions comes from physical activity and my resolve to become the strongest person I can<span id="calibre_link-1309"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If you aren’t putting your health and fitness first, it’s high time you change that.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1310" class="class9">Day 59: On Your Vices Masquerading as Virtues</div>
<div class="class20">No vice exists which does not pretend to be more or less like some virtue, and which does not take advantage of this assumed resemblance.</div>

<span class="class22">Jean de La Bruyère</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-0" class="class23">56</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Bad habits are so difficult to give up not only because they’re pleasant, but also because they often masquerade as virtues. When you think of your vice as a friend rather than your enemy, it’s even harder to eliminate it from your life.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, people who sleep in and suffer from low productivity might claim that, thanks to staying up late, they have a great social life. They fail to notice they’re paying too high a price for a benefit they could obtain in a different way without jeopardizing their long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">I used to believe that it was good to jump from one business idea to another. I thought that by trying different things, I would eventually find the perfect idea that would magically grow into a successful business.</div>
<div class="class14">In reality, I lacked the self-discipline to focus and wasted several years on endeavors that were destined to fail. Were there some benefits in spreading my attention so thin? Certainly. They weren’t more valuable than what I was losing, though, and what I considered a virtue was actually a vice that was sabotaging my goals<span id="calibre_link-1311"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Are there any vices of yours that might masquerade as virtues? Question your deeply-held beliefs and ask yourself if your supposed virtues are indeed helpful, or perhaps they’re like a friend that gives you one dollar with one hand while stealing five dollars from your wallet with the other.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-346" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1312" class="class9">Day 60: On Pressing On</div>
<div class="class20">Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination are omnipotent. The slogan “press on” has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Calvin Coolidge</div>
<div class="class14">When in doubt, press on. It sounds obvious and trite, yet the simple fact of life that people who are persistent are usually more successful than less-determined geniuses often escapes us. Time heals all wounds, and time &mdash; or rather, persistence that is exercised over a long period of time &mdash; also leads to success.</div>
<div class="class14">In the world of self-publishing, many authors are extremely talented, but they fail to achieve success because they give up after releasing one or two flops. Meanwhile, the ones who initially lack writing skills or formal education but keep on going, writing one book after another until one finally succeeds, are the ones who occupy the bestseller lists.</div>
<div class="class14">People who can speak foreign languages aren’t born with a gene that allows them to acquire them quickly. Most of them aren’t smarter than you or me, yet they manage to master several languages, including the ones that are thought to be almost impossible to learn by a foreigner. Their secret lies in persistence. If you learn 10 new words a day, you learn 3650 words a year. Consequently, within a few years you’ll possess an extensive <span id="calibre_link-1313"></span>
vocabulary &mdash; all thanks to a small, daily time investment that doesn’t require any special talents or being a genius.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently struggling with your goal, remind yourself that even if you feel like you’re lost in a maze, pressing on will eventually help you reach your destination and in many cases, it’s the only thing that separates the winners from the losers.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-698" class="class23">57</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">It’s important to approach your goals in a sustainable way, thinking in terms of months, years, or decades instead of mere days or weeks. However, at the same time, taking extreme actions can pay handsome dividends, too.</div>
<div class="class14">Balancing between the extreme and more sustainable approach is a difficult art, but in essence it comes down to taking extreme actions during a relatively brief period of time, while ensuring that your actions are sustainable over the long term.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, when my first book became a bestseller, I stuck to a strict publication schedule to benefit from the gained momentum. I launched my second book (on which I had been working since I finished the first draft of my first book) a mere three weeks later. My third book went live in another two weeks, and my fourth was released three weeks after the previous one.</div>
<div class="class14">From there, I slowed down my pace, but I still managed to release at least four new books each year. In the short term, my actions were extreme. And precisely because of that, I was able to build a large following quickly. However, after an initial sprint, you need to slow down to go the distance&mdash; and that’s when I transitioned to a little less extreme approach, but one still exhibited by few authors<span id="calibre_link-1315"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Are you taking extreme actions to gain momentum and separate yourself from the ones who don’t have the self-discipline needed to push themselves hard for a short period of time? How can you intensify your efforts for a couple of weeks or months to maximize your results before transitioning to a more sustainable and less extreme approach?</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">As we’ve already discussed several times, living your life the hard way makes it paradoxically easier, while avoiding the hard things makes your life more difficult.</div>
<div class="class14">When it comes to accomplishing your goals, the hard truth is that easy accomplishments often go away quickly, while larger projects produce more lasting results.</div>
<div class="class14">For one, setting close to impossible goals requires you to think in categories producing pivotal differences, and not mere tweaks.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, losing 5 pounds (or 2 kilos) requires a small tweak. You can eat less for two weeks and you’ll accomplish your goal. However, you won’t fix the underlying issue of being overweight, and probably soon regain the weight.</div>
<div class="class14">How about losing 50 pounds (or 20 kilos) this year? You can no longer afford to think in terms of small tweaks. You need a permanent change &mdash; a change in your habits and identity that will address the <span class="class11">cause</span>
 of the problem and lead to a permanent solution.</div>
<div class="class14">Audacious goals can also transform your life, while reaching safe, easy objectives won’t change much in the grand scheme of things.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to save a million dollars for retirement, you’ll need a different strategy than if you only want to save enough for a rainy-<span id="calibre_link-1317"></span>
day fund. A moonshot project of building a $1 million nest egg might lead you to building a business that will not only generate a million dollars for retirement, but also help you retire early &mdash; a pleasant side effect you initially didn’t anticipate at all.</div>
<div class="class14">As an additional benefit, big goals are more motivating, which means you’ll be less likely to give up when you encounter obstacles. Granted, you need to pursue the hard things in a smart way so that you won’t find yourself walking with your head in the clouds. Set an audacious goal, but accompany it with a realistic deadline. An ambitious goal is still a big accomplishment, even if it takes you years to achieve it.</div>

<div class="class14">A detailed vision of your wished-for future will fuel your resolve, compensating for any weaknesses you might have or difficulties that might stand on your way toward success.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I struggled with extreme shyness as a teenager. I set a goal to develop self-confidence and feel relaxed in all kinds of social settings. I was, and still am, an introverted lone wolf who needs solitude more than I need other people.</div>
<div class="class14">However, my will was strong. I knew I needed to make this change in order to stop limiting my personal growth, something I found and still find is one of my most important values. This deep desire kept me going, despite my personality being extremely unsuited to social settings<span id="calibre_link-1319"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Note that your deep desire doesn’t have to be about you. You’ve surely heard stories about people performing incredible feats of strength to rescue a victim of an accident. For example, in 2013 in Oregon, teenage sisters Hanna (age 16) and Haylee (age 14) lifted a 3,000-pound (1360 kg) tractor to save their father, who was pinned underneath it.<span id="calibre_link-1145"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-779" class="class25">60</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">The mechanism that supports such impossible actions still baffles scientists. We only know one thing for sure: under normal circumstances, Hanna and Haylee wouldn’t be able to lift a tractor. It was their will &mdash; their immense desire to save their father &mdash; that gave them superhuman strength.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">One might argue that it’s mere semantics &mdash; barriers or hurdles; both make it difficult to reach success. However, thinking of a problem as a <span class="class11">hurdle</span>
 means approaching it as something that you can possibly walk around or leap over, but a <span class="class11">barrier</span>
 sounds like something that is impermeable and a fixed limitation.</div>
<div class="class14">Nobody likes to face obstacles, but it’s thanks to the obstacles you face today that you gain the ability to overcome other hardships in the future &mdash; ones that would possibly crush you if it weren’t for the experience you’re having today.</div>
<div class="class14">Problem-solving skills are exactly that &mdash; skills. The more often you encounter problems and resolve them, the better you’ll get at dealing with them.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, as a great exercise for building self-discipline and mental resilience, I strongly suggest exposing yourself to difficult tasks. Embrace problems in your life and look at dealing <span id="calibre_link-1321"></span>
with difficulties as training yourself to see problems as hurdles instead of barriers.</div>
<div class="class14">Exert willpower to deal with the hard problems, instead of looking for the easiest way out. Consider several ways to tackle the issue and try to visualize how each solution can help you leap over the hurdle. You don’t necessarily have to throw problems at yourself from every direction; you can also practice by helping your friends solve their problems or by imagining you’re facing the problems you’re reading about in a book or seeing in a TV show.</div>
<div class="class14">Just for practice, imagine that you were about to launch your business when a key investor backed out, leaving you $20,000 short of the budget necessary to produce the first line of your product. To make matters worse, you’ve already accepted payments from your first clients and need to deliver within two months. Most people would consider it an impermeable barrier. Game over, say goodbye to your dreams. You, as a mentally resilient and self-disciplined person will look at it as a hurdle. What can you do to leap over it and keep going, despite such a difficulty being thrown in your way?</div>

<div class="class14">Whenever the topic of winning the lottery comes up in a conversation, I always say that what so many people consider the biggest blessing in their entire lives is actually the biggest curse for most people. Let me explain why, but first, some curious facts…</div>
<div class="class14">The numbers are terrifying. According to 2015 research from The Pew Charitable Trusts, 41 percent of respondents don’t have enough liquid savings to cover an unexpected $2,000 cost (such as a medical emergency) and a typical household can’t replace even one month of income with liquid savings.<span id="calibre_link-1004"></span>

</div>
<div class="class14">It’s important to note we aren’t talking about people living in poverty; the same respondents are the ones buying new homes, cars, TVs, smartphones, and other gadgets. The reason for their lack of savings isn’t lack of income; it’s lack of self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">While a small percentage of respondents probably do exercise some kind of financial self-control, a great majority doesn’t. What do you think? How likely would they be to exercise self-discipline with money upon winning the lottery if they can’t manage their finances now? Even if they won millions of dollars, later on they would be in the same spot as they are today &mdash; if not in an even <span id="calibre_link-1323"></span>
worse situation. That’s why winning the lottery &mdash; the dream of so many &mdash; can actually be the biggest curse.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, no matter how well off you are today, it’s of crucial importance to start saving your money now if you aren’t doing so already. It doesn’t matter if you’re saving ten dollars or ten thousand dollars a month; it’s the habit that counts. When your financial situation improves (and as a person interested in building self-discipline, it most likely will), it will ensure that you continue exerting self-control with money.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re lacking such a habit today, don’t fool yourself into thinking you’ll control your finances when you start making more. Build healthy financial habits when you have little disposable income, and saving money will be easier when you’ll have more money to save. And if you <span class="class11">do</span>
 win the lottery, you’ll thank me for encouraging you to instill financial discipline today!<br class="calibre" />

</div>
<div class="class14">Grumbling about everything is a favorite pastime of countless individuals, all over the world. It’s incredible how much time and energy people waste on something as pointless as complaining, particularly when they can do nothing about their source of protests.</div>
<div class="class14">It takes self-discipline to stop complaining &mdash; and a great deal of it if you’re like most people, who can’t go even one day without voicing their dissatisfaction with the world. Consequently, managing your complaints is a great exercise to improve your self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">Starting today, try to go without complaining for as long as you can. Whenever you catch yourself complaining, turn it into a solution, try to find something good about whatever dissatisfies you, or let it go if the solution is beyond your control or the problem isn’t worth your energy.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re at a restaurant and your meal isn’t as warm as you’d like it to be, you can ask the waiter to heat it (turning a complaint into a solution), consider it an exercise in voluntary discomfort (finding something good about the source of the complaint), or simply eat it, having decided that complaining about it isn’t worth your energy<span id="calibre_link-1325"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Such mental training will not only improve your impulse self-control, but also make you a more positive person. In contrast, what do you get out of complaining besides ruining your mood?</div>

<div class="class20">Every time you borrow money, you’re robbing your future self.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Nathan W. Morris</div>
<div class="class14">Borrowing money for consumption is a widespread disease in today’s world, fueled by excess and materialism. Unlike taking on a business loan to achieve a return on investment that is higher than the interest rate &mdash; a practice that, when done wisely, can enrich your future self &mdash; consumer loans only serve to satisfy the desire for instant gratification, while robbing (sometimes spectacularly) your future self.</div>
<div class="class14">Each time you’re thinking about getting a loan to satisfy a desire to own an item that belongs in the “want” category, imagine that you have the power to stop your past self from getting all the consumer loans you have today (if you don’t have any, pretend that you do). Just like that, you can erase all of them and finally gain peace of mind. Would you still go into debt to finance your toys?</div>
<div class="class14">Five years from now, you’ll look back at your past self, puzzled at how short-sighted you were to gift yourself with such a bad future for the fleeting gratification of getting a new car or TV.</div>
<div class="class14">“But I can get such great terms, it’s almost a free loan!” you’re saying? The terms don’t matter; the habit of prioritizing your present self over your future self eventually affects not only your finances, but every other area of your life.</div>
<div class="class14">Developing discipline to do without unnecessary feel-good purchases you can’t afford is one of the most important things you <span id="calibre_link-1327"></span>
can do to gain more self-control and ensure that your future is better than the present.</div>

<div class="class14">Second, materialistic rewards give fleeting happiness and often come with more problems than benefits. Just ask any owner of a Lamborghini how much fun it is to see people constantly taking pictures of their car, how fun it is to spend thousands of dollars for a simple check-up, or how stressed-out they are in the parking lot, afraid of an envious driver of a beat-up car dinging their shiny vehicle.</div>
<div class="class14">Last but most definitely not least, a powerful motivator should feel like a necessity, a thing you can’t live without, and not a mere toy that displays your high status, which ultimately nobody cares about.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re struggling to stick to your resolution, perhaps the only motivation you have is the extrinsic type, driven by money, fame, or <span id="calibre_link-1329"></span>
prizes. This type of motivation isn’t bad per se; what’s bad is when it’s the only thing that keeps you going.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you’re setting new goals, go beyond mere external rewards. Instead, support your self-discipline with intrinsic motivators &mdash; internal rewards, such as doing something out of a need to grow as a person, achieve more independence, realize your full potential, enjoy yourself, learn, or explore.</div>
<div class="class14">Combine this motivation with a need to make the world a better place, and you’ll have a powerful source of inspiration that will enable you to grin and bear the difficulties that you’ll undoubtedly encounter along the way.</div>

<div class="class14">If you think of your goal as a steep hill, imagine how ridiculous it would be to stop midway just because you’re slowly scrambling up instead of sprinting all the way to the top. That’s precisely what many people do when they start working on a new goal and realize that the journey will take longer than they expected.</div>
<div class="class14">What difference does it make that reaching a goal takes you longer than you planned? If you want to climb a steep hill, will you stop climbing it because you can’t climb it in two hours, but can in three? Will you retreat to the bottom of the hill and forever stare at its peak, frustrated by the dissatisfying pace of the climb?</div>
<div class="class14">Another mistake is the assumption that if something is slow in the beginning, it will stay that way.</div>
<div class="class14">When I started my career as a self-published author, I tried several different genres. Things were going slow at the beginning because I needed to figure out which genre and style fitted me best. Once I established the proper direction, I released my first bestseller, then the second, and soon there was a snowball effect. How wise would it have been to give up during the first several months, frustrated by the slow pace?</div>

<div class="class14">Limiting the time available to complete a given task is one of the most powerful secrets of productive people and a powerful way to overcome procrastination.</div>
<div class="class14">If you lack the self-control needed to work in a focused way, give yourself a challenging deadline to enforce concentration. Suddenly, what normally takes two hours to accomplish (or rather, two hours of intermittent work and distractions) will only take thirty minutes (or less) of 100% focused work at your highest potential.</div>
<div class="class14">At the moment I’m writing these words, I have a goal to write four entries in 50 minutes. Because of my self-imposed time pressure, I’m 100% focused on the task at hand. I can’t distract or second-guess myself, two things that interrupt the creative process and slow down my writing pace.</div>
<div class="class14">Since I have given myself little time to get the task done, procrastination is a non-issue &mdash; I can’t afford to dilly-dally because I’ll miss my deadline. To further motivate myself to work quickly, I established a reward for performing the task on time: reading the new autobiography of Richard Branson, one of my business idols.</div>
<div class="class14">This simple trick can become one of your most powerful allies toward increasing your productivity. If you’ve been putting off a <span id="calibre_link-1333"></span>
certain unpleasant task, get to it now, but instead of giving yourself plenty of time to finish it, do it in 25% of your usual timeframe.</div>
<div class="class14">The new, greatly shortened period of work should reduce your resistance to getting started, and the challenge of doing it more quickly should bring out some excitement that will additionally fuel your resolve to get it done.</div>

<div class="class14">When I was battling against my shyness, I set a goal to approach attractive women in the street. I knew that if I did it several dozen times, I would most likely overcome my social fears and transform into a new person.</div>
<div class="class14">What helped me act (in spite of immense anxiety) was the realization that talking myself out of approaching a woman would certainly equate to a “no.” Approaching her and getting rejected couldn’t worsen my situation. In fact, I could only gain, because even a rejection was still a valuable lesson I wouldn’t learn if I chose inaction.</div>
<div class="class14">Likewise, many people hesitate to start working on their goals out of a fear of failure or self-doubt. They fail to realize that if they don’t a take a step forward, they’ll be in the same place. Even if they take an unsuccessful step forward and need to backtrack, they’d still gain some experience. There’s nothing to lose, and potentially a lot to gain.</div>
<div class="class14">Are there any goals you’d like to pursue, but are afraid that you’ll embarrass yourself or fail? Have you ever considered that not acting on them leads to sure-fire failure, while an attempt gives you <span id="calibre_link-1335"></span>

<div class="class14">The focus is on the success, not the struggle. And it’s understandable &mdash; success is glamorous, memorable, and marketable, while the struggle is drab, disagreeable, and unattractive for the general public.</div>
<div class="class14">Yet, it’s making the effort, struggling, and sticking to your resolutions that shapes you as a person. Success is a reward for having given it your best, but it’s not always within your control whether and when you get to enjoy it.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you find yourself discouraged by your lack of success, remind yourself that the process alone is your reward.

<div class="class20">Fun is at the core of the way I like to do business and it has been key to everything I’ve done from the outset. More than any other element, fun is the secret of Virgin’s success. I am aware that the idea of business as being fun and creative goes right against the grain of convention, and it’s certainly not how they teach it at some of those business schools, where business means hard grind and lots of “discounted cash flows” and “net present values”.</div>

<div class="class14">Building self-discipline and working on your long-term goals doesn’t have to be a chore. In fact, if it is, you’ll have a hard time reaching success because if something bores you to tears or doesn’t produce much excitement, it’s difficult to stick to it in the long term.</div>
<div class="class14">Probably the most common area in which I see most people struggling because of lack of fun is exercise. If you succumb to the popular notion that exercise has to be repetitive, painful, and boring, guess what… A few weeks from now, you’ll be back in front of your TV, wondering what motivated you to do such a stupid thing as attending those torturous fitness classes.</div>
<div class="class14">The only way to develop a permanent habit of regular physical activity is to find an exercise you enjoy. Without the fun factor, exercise will always feel like a chore, and you probably already have enough obligations in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">The same applies to virtually any other endeavor. I treat my business seriously, but at the same time I’m trying to make it a bit more fun, either by throwing in a joke here and there while writing a <span id="calibre_link-1339"></span>
book, coming up with a fun writing challenge, or testing new exciting ideas.</div>

<div class="class14">For example, when I was working on my fitness goals, I acted a lot. I religiously followed my workout schedule and did everything I could to build a strong body, including eating foods recommended for bodybuilders, recording videos of my lifts to improve my technique, and even hiring a fitness coach.</div>
<div class="class14">I acted a lot, but thought too little.</div>

Today people criticize my books or send me impolite emails because I annoyed them in some unfathomable way.</div>

overnight. I discovered that it wasn’t anything new in the SEO industry. Google periodically introduced new updates and people like me regularly had to rebuild their businesses according to the new rules.</div>

<div class="class14">When people who are on a diet slip up, it’s not that one-off slip-up that causes them to fail; it’s their judgment about it, namely persuading themselves that since they made a mistake, all of their prior efforts are now for naught. What follows is self-guilt, which leads to self-doubt, which awakens the need to self-comfort, usually by eating forbidden foods (after all, in their minds they’ve already lost) and subsequently ruining their entire diet.</div>
<div class="class14">A similar phenomenon happens with other goals, too. A person saving money who was forced to spend their entire savings on an emergency expense might consider it a reason to stop saving money.

<div class="class14">Even though there’s “self” in the word “self-discipline,” it doesn’t mean that you need to refuse the help of other people or that you need to reinvent the wheel because you can’t make your decisions based on the knowledge acquired by other people. It’s easier to put up a fight against temptations and stick to your resolutions when others have your back. Learning from the experience of others, regardless if it’s in the form of a book or a conversation, makes things easier, too.</div>
<div class="class14">I’ve greatly benefited from the power of social support by participating in online forums. I’m pretty sure that if it weren’t for the people I’ve gotten to know over the years of my entrepreneurial journey, it would have been much harder for me to reach success. Knowing that the people who inspired me also had faced obstacles and were tempted to give up, it was easier for me to keep going when it was me who was facing the immense difficulties.</div>
<div class="class14">It doesn’t mean that you need to become great at making online friends, though. Most of the people who immensely helped me on my journey don’t even know me &mdash; it was the breadcrumbs they left <span id="calibre_link-1352"></span>
in the form of forum posts and articles that changed my life, not my friendship with them.</div>
<div class="class14">Another way to collaborate is to find a person who will hold you accountable: a friend who’s on the same journey as you or perhaps an online support group.</div>
<div class="class14">The key to benefiting from this strategy is choosing the right accountability partner. Go with a person who’s strict, rather than lax, so that when you don’t feel like doing something, he or she will push you to keep going rather than give you a pass and a pat on the back. Ideally, this person should be great at what you want to accomplish, and if not great, at least slightly better than you.</div>
<div class="class14">Last but most definitely not least, if there’s a way to accomplish your goal more quickly through working with a reputable coach and you can afford it, do that. I learned the fundamental knowledge about self-publishing in just a couple of weeks, thanks to working with a person who was knowledgeable about the industry. It greatly shortened my learning curve, inspired me, and helped me avoid several obstacles that would have otherwise tested my resolve, if not outright discouraged from entering this business.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Continuing the topic of support, by far the most important friend on my journey of building self-discipline, developing mental resilience, and working on my long-term goals were non-fiction books that were written by people who have achieved my dreams.</div>
<div class="class14">Book were, are, and will always be one of the most valuable things a person wishing to change themselves can learn from to make their dreams come true.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of idle talk about books being incredible &mdash; I think I’ve already made my case clear &mdash; today I want to share with you three books I believe you should read for education and inspiration. Here they are:</div>
<div class="class14">1. <span class="class11">The Millionaire Fastlane</span>
 by MJ DeMarco</div>
<div class="class14">
<span class="class11">The Millionaire Fastlane</span>
 was the book that changed it all for me when it comes not only to business, but also my attitude about work and life in general. In addition to countless lessons about how to start and run a successful business, you’ll learn how to become a person tuned in to the needs of others, a skill that will aid you in all kinds of endeavors<span id="calibre_link-1355"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Granted, not everyone equates success with financial success, so if you don’t care about achieving financial independence, you can probably skip this book.</div>
<div class="class14">2. <span class="class11">The One Thing</span>
 by Gary Keller</div>
<div class="class14">Richard Koch is the original author of books about the 80/20 principle (stating that 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort). I strongly recommend his books, but when it comes to the most accessible introduction to the topic, Gary Keller’s book is the winner.</div>
<div class="class14">The premise behind <span class="class11">The One Thing</span>
 is answering the following question: “What’s the one thing you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” The book delves deep into the details on why and how single focus is so powerful and important for success.</div>
<div class="class14">I’ve made this rule one of the most important guiding principles in my life and I strongly suggest implementing it in your life, too.</div>
<div class="class14">3. <span class="class11">A Guide to the Good Life</span>
 by William B. Irvine</div>
<div class="class14">Roman Stoicism adapted to the modern world by William B. Irvine is one of the most helpful life philosophies you can embrace to live a happier life.</div>
<div class="class14">Stoics were also big on self-control, mental resilience and preparedness, so Irvine’s book is an all-encompassing guide on how to banish negative emotions, gain more happiness, and become a more valuable member of society<span id="calibre_link-1356"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">The most important takeaway for me is practicing your resilience by visualizing bad events. I regularly use this strategy for reducing worry and increasing my peace of mind.<span id="calibre_link-365"></span>

<div class="class9">Day 80: On Cultivating Positivity When Things Go Bad</div>
<div class="class20">Good humor is a tonic for mind and body. It is the best antidote for anxiety and depression. It is a business asset. It attracts and keeps friends. It lightens human burdens. It is the direct route to serenity and contentment.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Grenville Kleiser</div>
<div class="class14">Treating everything seriously is a sure-fire recipe for frustration and depression, particularly when you repeatedly get hit with one obstacle after another with no chance to catch your breath. Negative thoughts can sprout in even the most positive minds, but it’s your choice whether you nurture them or pull them out.</div>
<div class="class14">When I was struggling to grow one of my businesses, my laptop broke down. I not only had to buy a new computer to be able to continue working, but also pay a steep fee to have my data recovered (I’ve since learned how important regular data backup is!).</div>
<div class="class14">To make matters worse, all of that happened while I was deep in debt. I tried to keep my spirits high, but make no mistake &mdash; it was one of the darkest, most hopeless periods of my life. Still, if it weren’t for at least trying to be positive about the future, I’m sure I would have had a challenging time sticking to the business that had landed me in so much trouble.</div>
<div class="class14">I’m not going to sugarcoat it. You <span class="class11">will</span>

<div id="calibre_link-1358" class="class9">Day 81: On Identifying Your Resources</div>
<div class="class20">With every accident, ask yourself what abilities you have for making a proper use of it.

If you hear unpleasant language, you will find patience.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">For every problem you face, there’s an ability or resource you can tap into to overcome it. The key is to discover what it is and immediately put it to use. Unfortunately, many people default to discouragement or frustration rather than adopt a resourceful attitude and look for possible solutions.</div>
<div class="class14">Little good comes out of covering your eyes, wishing the problem will go away on its own. The best way to prepare yourself for setbacks is to visualize them and seek solutions before these problems materialize. Not all of your negative predictions will come to pass, but the ones that do won’t paralyze you as much if you prepare yourself for them.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re on a diet, think of some common scenarios that might jeopardize your adherence to it. What will you do if somebody you always wanted to meet invites you to dinner at a less than healthy restaurant? What will you do if you find yourself starving at the airport while waiting for the connecting flight? What <span id="calibre_link-1359"></span>
will you do when you fail to resist the temptation to eat chocolate and turn an unplanned treat into a full-blown cheat day?</div>
<div class="class14">By creating a list of potential solutions while being at the top of your game and not being influenced by negative emotions, you’ll save yourself the time and energy that is wasted on trying to solve problems with a clouded mind.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1360" class="class9">Day 82: On Extreme Focus</div>
<div class="class20">Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life &mdash; think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Swami Vivekananda</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1147"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-709" class="class23">77</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">While flawless, 100% focus on a single idea is close to impossible for a modern human being, there’s a lot you can gain from focusing as much as you can on just one goal. In fact, I consider it so important that I wrote an entire book about it titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Focus-Strategy-Develop-Powerful-ebook/dp/B06XWTJPJG/" class="pcalibre pcalibre1 class27">The Ultimate Focus Strategy</a>
.</div>
<div class="class14">There are two primary benefits of making a single idea your life.</div>
<div class="class14">The first one is that limiting your focus to a single thing requires a great deal of self-discipline, which subsequently makes it an excellent exercise in cultivating self-control. I’ve acquired a lot of self-discipline (and finally achieved my goal of building a successful business) thanks to limiting my focus to one business model. Sticking to one thing has taught me the value of patience, dedication, and made me realize how powerful small (and consistent) improvements can be over the long term.</div>
<div class="class14">The second benefit of extreme focus is that by centering your life around the one most important endeavor, you’ll be more likely to reach it than if you were to spread your attention thin.</div>
<div class="class14">You have higher chances of implementing new nutritional habits and losing 20 pounds (or 10 kilos) in the next six months than trying to lose weight while also implementing a new workout routine, <span id="calibre_link-1361"></span>
building a side business, fighting against your fear of public speaking, saving money for an emergency fund, and learning a foreign language.</div>
<div class="class14">If self-discipline is a resource that you can deplete (scientists are still trying to figure it out), it makes sense to spend it judiciously, starting with your most important goal.</div>
</div>


<div id="calibre_link-368" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1362" class="class9">Day 83: On Changing Your Identity</div>
<div class="class20">Every time you make a decision to stick with your principles instead of indulging your weaknesses, you get stronger spiritually. And eventually this spiritual strength becomes a part of your identity. I don’t think of myself as a nonsmoker or “ex-” anything, because smoking and other vices are things I would never do in a million years.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Frank McKinney</span>
<span id="calibre_link-244"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-243" class="class23">78</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">The only way to instill a permanent change is to change your identity. As long as you define yourself by a behavior you want to eliminate, your efforts to change will be in vain because subconsciously, you’ll treat your changes as a temporary situation.</div>
<div class="class14">I don’t define myself as a person who doesn’t take drugs &mdash; I’ve never done drugs and never plan on doing them. Why would I define myself as a non-drug user?</div>
<div class="class14">In essence, that’s what people do when they say they’re ex-smokers or ex-convicts. That’s behind you. Embrace the present and develop a different, positive definition of yourself that will explain who you are and what you do today, not what you’re no longer about or what you’re no longer doing.</div>
<div class="class14">As a vegetarian, I don’t think of myself as a person who used to eat meat. I’m a person who eats a plant-based diet. It doesn’t matter how flavorful you tell me this piece of chicken is &mdash; I won’t eat it<span id="calibre_link-1363"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Your decision to be self-disciplined has to be equally firm. Don’t define yourself as a person who used to be lazy or lacking discipline. Define yourself as a person who’s doing his or her best to ensure the best future possible. No matter how enticing the temptations are, your self-definition will ensure that you’ll stay away from them.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1364" class="class9">Day 84: On Work and Chatter</div>
<div class="class20">The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other.</div>
<div class="class26">Let the others slap each other on the back while you’re back in the lab or the gym or pounding the pavement.</div>
<div class="class21">

<span id="calibre_link-797"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-788" class="class23">79</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">If you often talk about what you’re <span class="class11">going</span>
 to do instead of <span class="class11">doing</span>
 it, you’re not only wasting time you could have spent working on your goal, but also run the risk of not doing anything at all.</div>
<div class="class14">Self-congratulatory chatter carries with it the danger that you confuse it with what actually matters: work. Merely <span class="class11">talking</span>
 about your goals doesn’t turn you into a person who is working on them.</div>
<div class="class14">This phenomenon is most visible in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs who talk the most are usually the ones doing the least. They attend every seminar, meet-up, workshop, and are heavy social media users, but when it comes to making actual progress with their business, somehow it slips between the cracks. Some of them don’t even have an actual business. They’re in a never-ending “research phase.”</div>
<div class="class14">But don’t worry, everybody thinks you’re taking a lot of action based on how much you talk about business and that’s what matters, right? Sadly, while it can gain you points for popularity among the gullible, it isn’t a substitute for work and achievement.</div>
<div class="class14">To ensure that you actually <span class="class11">do</span>
 the work and get the results, be cautious talking about your goals with others. Use a simple rule of <span id="calibre_link-1365"></span>
thumb: if you’re talking merely to show off, save it. If you’re talking to gather valuable feedback or get support, do it, but what’s more important, actually <span class="class11">act</span>
 on the advice you receive.<br class="calibre" />

<div id="calibre_link-1366" class="class18">WEEK 13</div>
<div id="calibre_link-371" class="class19">Day 85: On Experimenting to See What Happens</div>
<div class="class20">It often feels like everything is so serious &mdash; that if you make one mistake, it will all end in disaster. But really everything you do is just a test: an experiment to “see what happens”.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-970"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-820" class="class23">80</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">I learned how to feel good in spite of failure when I adopted the “let’s see what happens” mentality. Now, whenever I want to try something new that has an uncertain chance of success, I tell myself it’s an experiment. I assume that whatever I invest in it, I invest it to gather data, and not necessarily to get a return.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I started investing in video courses for my business. In the end, it was a spectacular failure, but I wasn’t particularly worried about it because my experiment was still a success: it proved that my business idea wasn’t a good one. I also learned a lot working on this goal, and that alone was worth it. I’m not sure if I would have taken action if I had told myself that this endeavor absolutely must deliver a positive return.</div>
<div class="class14">You can apply the same mentality to every other goal. For example, if you’re afraid that you’ll fail to develop a habit of getting up early, consider it a 30-day experiment to see how waking up early will make you feel and whether you’ll be more productive. When you think of it this way, you ensure from the get-go that no matter <span id="calibre_link-1367"></span>
how your experiment goes, it’s a success. After all, you aren’t trying to make a permanent change: you only want to test a hypothesis.</div>
<div class="class14">Usually, if the experiment goes well, it leads to a permanent change anyway, and that’s the purpose of adopting this different mindset: you’re breaking through the initial resistance by lowering your expectations, and you consequently eliminate the fear of failure.</div>

Success</div>
<div class="class20">I’ve come to believe that success at anything has a spillover effect on other things. You can take advantage of that effect by becoming good at things that require nothing but practice.

</div>
<div class="class14">The first time I discovered that success in one area results in success in other walks of life was when I started exercising. Thanks to my own efforts, I got stronger, lost weight and gained some muscle. This small success made me realize that I had control over my life.</div>
<div class="class14">From then on, I embarked on other projects to change my life, including objectives as varied as overcoming shyness and building self-confidence, launching my first business, living in a foreign country, learning foreign languages, and eventually becoming a self-published author.</div>
<div class="class14">If you don’t believe in your abilities to succeed, heed Scott Adams’ advice and pick something that requires nothing but practice to become good at it. Invest several months of your life into it and when you notice progress &mdash; based entirely on your own efforts, not “luck” &mdash; I’m sure you’ll discover in yourself the power to tackle other challenges<span id="calibre_link-1370"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to that, every goal you’re consistently working on will help you develop the proper habits and traits needed to achieve success. Whether it’s learning how to play chess, dancing, learning Russian, setting up a backyard garden, or mastering table tennis, the real-world experience of going from a complete newbie to a person knowledgeable about the topic will transform you from the inside out.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1371" class="class9">Day 87: On Attributing Failure to <span id="calibre_link-1372" class="calibre2"></span>
External Factors</div>
<div class="class20">When interpreting their own failures (...) individuals tend to make external attributions, pointing to factors that are outside of their direct control (such as luck). As a result, their motivation to exert effort on the same task in the future is reduced.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Bradley R. Staats</span>
<span id="calibre_link-167"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-166" class="class23">82</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Failure can offer valuable feedback that will help you achieve your goal. Unfortunately, many people lose the learning opportunity by attributing the failure to an external factor, such as luck.</div>
<div class="class14">Consequently, instead of identifying the root cause in something <span class="class11">they</span>
 did, they wrongly assume that they had no control over the situation. This not only makes them less likely to exert equal effort during subsequent attempts (which in itself reduces their chances of success), but also increases the risk they’ll repeat the same mistakes over and over again.</div>
<div class="class14">As a result, they enter a downward spiral: each failure makes them less motivated to try again, and soon they give up, frustrated at how unfair the world is. It wasn’t really the world that was responsible; it was their own failure to take responsibility for their failure and learn from it.</div>
<div class="class14">Make sure that whenever you fail, you always look for the cause of the failure in something that <span class="class11">you</span>
 did, and not in something that you couldn’t control<span id="calibre_link-1373"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Even when it looks as if something was indeed outside of your control, it doesn’t mean that you didn’t make any mistakes that might have increased the chances of such an outcome. Identifying those mistakes &mdash; even if they were only partially responsible for the failure &mdash; will help you in future attempts and prevent you from developing the unhelpful mindset that you don’t have direct influence over your life.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you weren’t hired by your dream company, perhaps it wasn’t your fault. Maybe there was a better candidate, the hiring manager didn’t like you, or the company later decided against hiring a new employee.</div>
<div class="class14">However, even in such a case, it’s valuable to ponder whether there was anything you could have done better. Perhaps you could have improved your resume, asked better questions during the interview, or been better prepared for the questions you had assumed were unlikely to be asked.</div>
<div class="class14">Maybe it still wouldn’t have resulted in success, but at least that way you will have learned something new that will increase your chances of getting hired the next time, and consequently, you get to lift your spirits and boost your determination.</div>

<div class="class20">People will do almost anything to stay in their comfort zones. If you want to accomplish anything, get out of your comfort zone. Strive to increase order and discipline in your life. Discipline usually means doing the opposite of what you feel like doing.</div>

<div class="class14">I used to be terrified of heights. When I was a teenager, I remember shaking with fear while I stood on top of a 130-feet (40 meters) tower, afraid to approach the railing. Today, I hike through the high mountains and climb cliffs up to the same height as that of the tower. I jumped out of the airplane, visited the tallest building in the world as of 2017 (Burj Khalifa in Dubai) and flew in a hot-air balloon &mdash; things I would have never done in a million years if it weren’t for my consistent attempts to face my fear of heights.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t get me wrong: I still experience fear, but it has greatly diminished, thanks to years of stepping outside of my comfort zone. Exposing myself to heights was the opposite of what I felt like doing, but I knew it was necessary to help me grow. What started as a mere desire to get rid of a fear of heights turned into a full-blown personal transformation.</div>
<div class="class14">Whether it’s a fear of heights, an aversion to exercise, or any other kind of animosity toward the uncomfortable, scary, or out of the ordinary, stretching your comfort zone by gradually exposing yourself to such stimuli will lead to immense personal growth.</div>
<div class="class14">I strongly recommend regularly stepping outside your comfort zone in both little and big ways<span id="calibre_link-1375"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Little ways can include something as simple as pushing a little bit harder during a workout or working for a little while longer when you feel like you’re about to fall asleep.</div>
<div class="class14">Big ways include things like skydiving if you’re afraid of heights, camping in the wilderness if your biggest love in life is your warm, comfortable bed, or learning public speaking when you’re terrified of speaking in front of more than two people.</div>
<div class="class14">As uncomfortable and difficult it is to step outside your comfort zone, it pays incredible dividends in the long run. Make it an inherent part of your life to expose yourself to discomfort and face your fears head on. Few things will change your life more than going outside of your comfort zone.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-220" class="class23">84</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Self-discipline comes down to choosing between instant and delayed gratification. Instant gratification feels good today but compromises your long-term goals, while delayed gratification usually doesn’t deliver much in the way of instant pleasure, but it can lead to bigger rewards in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">Sometimes you’ll find yourself in a situation in which you’ll be able to make excuses; they may even sound so sensible that (upon hearing your rationalizations) nobody would question your backing out of that situation. However, don’t let them fool you &mdash; even if there’s <span class="class11">some</span>
 legitimacy to them, in most cases it’s still nothing other than choosing instant gratification.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you want to establish a habit of jogging three times a week and one day it rains and you’re afraid you’ll get sick, you have a valid excuse to skip exercise. After all, there <span class="class11">is</span>
 a higher risk of getting sick when running in bad weather, right?</div>
<div class="class14">However, it sets a dangerous precedent: you’re making a decision that your habits depend on the weather. Your self-control (or your lack of it) is now at the mercy of external factors, largely dependent on whether jogging in the given circumstances is easy or not. Is this the right way to build mental toughness and self-discipline<span id="calibre_link-1377"></span>
?</div>
<div class="class14">If you decide to keep going instead of defaulting to the easy choice of using (partly valid) excuses, you’ll immensely strengthen your resolve.

<div class="class14">They say that quitters never win, and winners never quit. However, quitting is sometimes more beneficial than stubbornly sticking to something that’s not working for you. The key is to quit in a smart way &mdash; as the result of a process of logical thinking, not on a whim in the heat of the moment.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, after a couple of years of sticking to a bodybuilding routine I’d grown tired of it. I was often so annoyed during the workout that I wanted to stop it and go home. However, doing so would have allowed my temporary state of mind to make the decision &mdash; and <span class="class11">that</span>
 could have negatively affected my resolve in similar situations in the future where, having once allowed myself to quit on a whim, I would consider it a sensible thing to do again.</div>
<div class="class14">I took my time and carefully considered the implications of giving up bodybuilding before I finally parted ways with it. This way, I quit <span class="class11">strategically</span>
 instead of <span class="class11">impulsively</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently discouraged with a certain goal of yours, make a decision that you won’t quit until you can make a logical, educated decision that will take into account all of the repercussions <span id="calibre_link-1379"></span>
of doing so. After carefully considering your options and their logical consequences, if you still want to quit, you’re probably making the right choice.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s a principle to introduce today and adhere to it for the rest of your life: whenever you’re saying “I’m going to start tomorrow,” stop whatever you’re doing now and do something &mdash; anything &mdash; to start <span class="class11">now</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">It doesn’t have to be anything big and it doesn’t mean you have to be reckless and start working on your goals without any kind of research on how to tackle your new challenge. Just take an action that is in alignment with your new resolution and it will take you at least a little bit closer to accomplishing your objectives.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s say you want to start a new diet. Instead of saying that you’re going to start tomorrow, take the first action today: inspect your pantry, lay out on the table all of the foods that you’re going to give up, and get them out of your house.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to start saving money, don’t put it off until your next paycheck. Inspect your house, find things you no longer use and list them online for sale. The money you make from selling your old possessions goes straight to your emergency fund.</div>
<div class="class14">Such simple actions are real-world implementations of your new resolution and will greatly diminish the risk that when you wake up the next day, you won’t remember your decision to change your life (<span id="calibre_link-1381"></span>
or tell yourself that you need one more day before you start). They also make it easier to overcome your inertia and begin to develop momentum toward reaching your stated goal.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-379" class="class19">Day 92: On Pleasure Gained from Abstaining</div>
<div class="class20">If you are struck by the appearance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being hurried away by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time: that in which you will enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself after you have enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will be glad and applaud yourself if you abstain.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-921" class="class23">87</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">When you delay gratification, it’s tempting to think about it in black and white: delaying gratification means no pleasure now in exchange for pleasure in the future. Succumbing to instant gratification means some pleasure now at the expense of your future. In reality, things aren’t that simple.</div>
<div class="class14">As Epictetus says, there’s pleasure to be found in abstaining. When you successfully deny yourself something, even if you feel deprived of it, at the same time you’ll feel proud of acting in accordance with your values and long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">And what might surprise you is that there’s some pain found in instant gratification. Yes, you get to enjoy the reward right now, but this also means that you’re betraying your future self. You’re missing out on the positive feelings you could have gotten by <span id="calibre_link-1383"></span>
successfully exerting willpower and in the end, the anger you feel at yourself might not be worth the initial pleasure.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1384" class="class9">Day 93: On Connecting Dots</div>
<div class="class20">Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something &mdash; your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">All you need to do to achieve your long-term goals is to stick to them. Easy to say, hard to do, particularly when working on those objectives means months upon months of depriving yourself, making sacrifices and hard choices.</div>
<div class="class14">That’s why the belief that things will connect in the end is so important for maintaining a high level of self-discipline over the long term. Willpower alone is a precious tool in your arsenal, but if it isn’t combined with the confidence that one day it will all be worth it, you may run out of juice well before reaching that point.</div>
<div class="class14">When I started my entrepreneurial life, I instilled in myself the belief that no matter what would happen along the way, every sacrifice, hardship, blood, sweat, and tears would be worth it in the end. I had a powerful reason why, and I was confident that I could make it come true.</div>
<div class="class14">If it weren’t for this belief, I know that I would have given up before reaching my objective. And with a more than fair share of knockout-like failures, this would have probably happened a long <span id="calibre_link-1385"></span>
time before the dots would have finally connected. It took me seven years before all of my dots &mdash; previous experiences and acquired skills &mdash; connected and helped me build a successful self-publishing company.</div>
<div class="class14">When in doubt, remind yourself that change takes time. What you now see as completely unrelated things can soon connect and form a beautiful picture.</div>

<div class="class14">“I was angry, so I shouted at her.” But does <span class="class11">feeling</span>

 it, or did shouting at your spouse simply feel better than trying to resist the urge to do so?</div>
<div class="class14">“I felt so joyous, I had to buy it to celebrate.” There’s nothing wrong in celebration, but if every joyous occasion leads to unnecessary purchases to treat yourself, isn’t your joy really acting as an apparently legitimate excuse for not saving money?</div>
<div class="class14">Take notice of whenever you overidentify with your emotions. How often do you use them as excuses for failing to exert self-control? Letting your fleeting feelings control your actions is a sure-fire way to jeopardize your resolve to become a self-disciplined person.</div>

Workouts</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;Arnold Schwarzenegger</span>
<span id="calibre_link-694"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-693" class="class23">90</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">There’s a reason why so many successful people wake up early: early mornings tend to be free of distractions &mdash; people asking things of you, emergencies you need to tend to, and dozens of obligations you need to fulfill. By the time other people are awake, the early risers have accomplished more than the rest will accomplish during their entire workday.</div>
<div class="class14">One of the best ways to start a day is with exercise. For one, exercising in the morning means that you’ll always have time to perform this crucial habit. Leaving exercise for the evening carries the risk of skipping it because of tiredness or other pressing things that require your attention.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, exercising in the morning sets a powerful example for the rest of the day: you start the day with a conscious decision to do something that requires self-control and dedication. The way you start your day is usually the way the entire day unfolds.</div>
<div class="class14">Last but not least, training early is usually most effective because that’s when you have the most energy. It’s hard to have the <span id="calibre_link-1389"></span>
same reserves of willpower and stamina in the evening, after you’ve depleted a lot of your mental energy on other things.</div>
<div class="class14">If possible, try to include exercise in your morning routine. It doesn’t have to be an entire workout if for some reason you need to have your workout in the evening. Even just a few reps of some simple exercises, some stretching or a quick walk around the block can provide benefits and start your day on the right note.</div>

e</div>
<div class="class20">Silence is the absolute poise or balance of body, mind, and spirit. The man who preserves his selfhood ever calm and unshaken by the storms of existence &mdash; not a leaf, as it were, astir on the tree; not a ripple upon the surface of shining pool &mdash; his, in the mind of the unlettered sage, is the ideal attitude and conduct of life. (…) If you ask [him]: “What are the fruits of silence?” he will say: “They are self-control, true courage or endurance, patience, dignity, and reverence. Silence is the cornerstone of character.”</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Charles Alexander Eastman</span>
<span id="calibre_link-880"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-879" class="class23">91</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">In today’s noisy world, silence is uncomfortable. Most of us rarely, if ever, experience true silence. We listen to podcasts when exercising, listen to music when commuting, and interrupt work with a chat or two with colleagues.</div>
<div class="class14">Silence is uncomfortable, because it means there are no outside distractions: it’s just you and your thoughts. Silence in a conversation is even more uncomfortable because there’s an unspoken rule that when people have nothing to talk about, they should come up with any topic just to avoid an awkward silence that might require them to become fully present and aware of how they really feel.</div>
<div class="class14">Since silence can bring so much discomfort, it can be a potent tool to improve your self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">First, sitting in silence and listening to your inner thoughts without any external distractions can help you slow down and analyze your recent decisions or assess how well you’re doing with your new goals. Try to spend at least five minutes a week in silence <span id="calibre_link-1392"></span>
and you’ll be surprised how much valuable feedback you can retrieve from within you.</div>
<div class="class14">As a second strategy, embrace silence in a conversation. No, I don’t mean that you should make the conversation weird by deliberately not saying anything. I refer to using silence as an exercise in improving your self-control when dealing with other people.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, try the following challenge for one day: when talking with somebody who has a different opinion than you do, resist the temptation to immediately attack them and instead listen silently until they have fully presented their arguments. You will have positioned yourself for a more intelligent participation in the conversation, simply because you took the time to listen carefully to what the other person said.</div>
<div class="class14">Another exercise is to practice self-control by using fewer words. For one day, focus on <span class="class11">listening</span>
 to the other person. Ask as many questions as you can to maintain an interesting conversation and resist the urge to comment or share too many of your opinions.</div>
<div class="class14">Both of these exercises will train you to be more focused on the other person and less impulsive during a conversation.</div>

<div class="class14">Whenever you’re reading a non-fiction book for educational purposes, try to find at least one important lesson that you’ll apply in your life. It doesn’t have to be anything big &mdash; the point is to develop a habit of applying at least <span class="class11">some</span>
 knowledge from each book you read.</div>
<div class="class14">I’ll give you some examples from my own reading list.</div>
<div class="class14">When I read <span class="class11">The One Thing</span>
 by Gary Keller, I decided to always seek only one key action to improve any given area of my life. In the case of my self-publishing business, it was the decision to stick to a consistent publishing schedule (an activity I discovered to be the one thing that makes everything else easier or unnecessary) and foregoing any other endeavors that take a lot of time, but bring few results (such as participating in social media)<span id="calibre_link-1399"></span>

</div>
<div class="class14">One good way to boost your willpower when you’re struggling to maintain it is to remind yourself of the benefits of self-control. In other words, give yourself an answer as to why you should resist yet another temptation and stay self-disciplined. Failing to find a good answer will make you succumb to the urge, so it’s useful to know as many practical benefits of self-discipline as possible.</div>
<div class="class14">One overlooked benefit of self-control &mdash; or a big weakness in a person who lacks it &mdash; is that leadership is impossible without it. If you demand self-discipline from others, you should first have it yourself. Otherwise, you’ll lack the credibility that makes other people want to follow you.</div>
<div class="class14">This applies not only to the most common use of the word “leader” (such as a business leader), but also to any other role in which you’re responsible for the well-being of another person of a group of people &mdash; being a parent, being in a relationship, being a part of a local community, etc.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you’re struggling to stay disciplined, think of people whom you consider your loyal “followers,” whether they’re your colleagues, your children, your friends, or your neighbors.</div>
<div class="class14">What would they think of you &mdash; and would they still be willing to follow you &mdash; if they knew that you’d failed to embrace the <span id="calibre_link-1401"></span>

<a href="#calibre_link-276" class="class23">96</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Some people wrongly believe that self-discipline is a never-ending series of battles with temptations. Today you’re battling against the temptation to drink wine, tomorrow you’ll battle against the temptation of laziness, and the day after tomorrow you’ll struggle with a temptation to eat pizza instead of steamed vegetables. In the meantime, you’ll have dozens of smaller skirmishes, each attacking you from a different front.</div>
<div class="class14">In reality, if your life looks like that, there’s little chance that you’ll stay self-disciplined in the long haul. The ultimate goal is to design your life in such a way that you’ll rarely fight against temptations. There are three primary tools you can use for that:</div>
<div class="class14">1. Identity change. When your identity changes, you no longer need to desperately fight against temptations because you don’t see them as such. If eating potato chips daily is no longer a part of your identity, there’s no temptation to defeat; previously overpowering urges are now a non-issue because they are incongruent with your new identity.</div>
<div class="class14">2. Habits. Unlike identity change, you might still need <span class="class11">some</span>
 self-discipline to act or to overcome a temptation, but it will be only a <span id="calibre_link-1403"></span>
modicum of what had been necessary before you established your routine. Instead of a full-blown battle, either you won’t need to fight at all, or it will be a short brawl at most.</div>
<div class="class14">3. Avoiding temptations. If you don’t want to eat fast food, avoid fast food restaurants. There’s little benefit in needlessly exposing yourself to temptations, particularly when you know that the enemy is hard to beat.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Deconstructing a temptation piece by piece can uncover interesting facts about why you engage in them at all. Of course, you can say that you eat chocolate simply because you enjoy its taste. However, what if there’s a deeper meaning behind it, a need it fulfills beyond the need for something sweet to eat? If you address this need in a different, more positive way, you’ll no longer need to eat chocolate.</div>
<div class="class14">I’ll share with you a personal example of mine. I was once going through a period in which I couldn’t control my eating. I would eat a big meal that would normally satisfy me for the entire day, and then would continue eating afterward &mdash; sometimes a few snacks, sometimes another large meal an hour or two later.</div>
<div class="class14">I discovered that the primary reason behind this behavior wasn’t hunger in itself; I ate a lot because I didn’t have anything productive to do, and I didn’t have anything productive to do because I felt slightly depressed. I was in a downward spiral: I was low-spirited and demotivated, so I didn’t take any actions that led to boredom. <span id="calibre_link-1405"></span>
Then, because I wanted to fill my days with <span class="class11">something</span>
, I filled them with food. When I came up with a new business goal and started working more, the problem soon disappeared.</div>
<div class="class14">Think about your problematic behaviors and temptations and seek a deeper meaning behind them. Why do you use these particular methods to comfort or distract yourself? Why do you need to comfort or distract yourself in the first place? What is the trigger or emotional need that leads to the negative behavior and what kind of emotional payoff do you expect to get out of engaging in it?</div>

<div class="class14">Fire is a natural part of the forest ecology. Regular small fires serve a cleansing purpose, reducing the amount of fuel build-up and consequently lowering the likelihood of a potentially large, disastrous fire.</div>
<div class="class14">Fires promote the growth and biodiversity of surviving healthy vegetation when the old, sickly trees burn and the ashes add nutrients to the soil. Moreover, burned trees provide habitat for the wildlife which often grows in numbers after a fire.</div>
<div class="class14">A controlled burn is a strategy that foresters around the world use to regulate plant and animal life, usually as a way to reduce the risk of a larger, uncontrolled fire.</div>
<div class="class14">You can use a similar strategy: give yourself some slack every now and then to prevent yourself from a massive, uncontrollable loss of self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">The most obvious application of this technique is in dieting: allowing yourself a cheat meal every now and that will help you avoid an unplanned cheat day or cheat week that could result in disastrous consequences for your long-term progress.</div>
<div class="class14">You can use a controlled burn in any other endeavor that requires you to maintain high levels of self-discipline for a long <span id="calibre_link-1407"></span>
period of time. For example, if you’re working hard on your business, every other week give yourself an entire day to slack off instead of working your fingers to the bone and burning out.</div>
<div class="class14">Controlled burns, as long as they remain <span class="class11">controlled</span>
 and limited to a defined period of time, can increase your long-term discipline, so don’t feel guilty about scheduling one every now and then. You might temporarily lose some momentum, but in the long haul it will be worth it.<br class="calibre" />

<div class="class14">If you’re telling yourself that once the conditions are right, you’ll surely do it, count how many times you told yourself the same thing before (and didn’t ever do it at all) and add one more instance &mdash; because that’s what most certainly will happen this time, too.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1409" class="class9">Day 105: On Predicting When You’ll Give In</div>
<div class="class20">People who think they have the most willpower are actually the most likely to lose control when tempted. Why? They fail to predict when, where, and why they will give in.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-780" class="class23">100</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">If you don’t know yourself well, you’ll struggle with building self-discipline because temptations will often catch you unprepared.</div>
<div class="class14">A key practice you should embrace in your everyday life is to make a note of when, where, and why you give in to temptations. This knowledge will help you structure your life in such a way that you’ll reduce the chances of a similar situation happening again or help you become prepared to overcome the urge when it arises again.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I know that when I take a nap during the day, I’ll most likely wake up hungry. I have no idea why; all I know is that if I fall asleep during the day, it’s almost guaranteed that I’ll wake up so hungry that I’ll have to eat something &mdash; and while it’s usually a piece of fruit and some nuts, often (in my still groggy state) I’ll overeat.</div>
<div class="class14">Consequently, whenever I feel tired and know that I’ll need to take a nap, I mentally prepare myself for the hunger when I wake up. If I can, I simply eat less prior to taking the nap so that when I wake up, I won’t eat more than my intended daily calorie ration. Alternatively, I try to set up a meeting with a friend so that when I <span id="calibre_link-1410"></span>
wake up, I’ll immediately have to leave, with no time to spare for a visit to the pantry.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of some of your most common slip-ups and figure out when, where, and why they happen. What can you do when you’re most likely to give in to the temptation? What can you do to avoid visiting the venue where they’re most likely to happen? Why do you think you’re succumbing to this temptation and is there any other way in which you can address the need this temptation fulfills, without actually giving in to it?</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-815" class="class23">101</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Publicly refusing instant gratification &mdash; such as ordering a salad when everybody around you orders a pizza &mdash; can result in criticism from other people. If you lack trust in yourself, this negative feedback can cause self-doubt and compromise your long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">As Marcus Aurelius points out, it’s a curious fact that even though we consider ourselves the most important people in our lives, we still often value the opinion of others more than our own.</div>
<div class="class14">Usually people who are the opposite of what you want to accomplish criticize you out of fear of being inferior to you. If you manage to reach success, what does it say about them? Consequently, even if they aren’t malicious by nature, you may sense resistance coming from their direction, often masquerading as good-hearted advice, but intended to make you conform to the status quo.</div>
<div class="class14">While I doubt that there is a foolproof way to stop valuing the opinion of others more than our own (and I doubt that it would be <span id="calibre_link-1412"></span>
smart to assume that we know everything best) forever, there is a way to protect yourself from self-doubt upon hearing criticism.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s really quite simple. Whenever somebody criticizes your choices, ask yourself if they can serve as a model for you. If your overweight friend ridicules your resolution to stop eating fast food, is his or her opinion valuable for you? Does he or she set a positive example and have the credibility to change your mind? If not, why listen to him or her?</div>

But lives go down the tubes one repetition at a time, one deflection at a time, one hundred and forty characters at a time.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">While it may seem that I place self-discipline as the most important thing in life, I want to clarify that that’s not the case. We weren’t made for work alone and it’s important to celebrate what life has to offer, particularly as a reward after a job well done.</div>
<div class="class14">However, we weren’t made for constantly entertaining ourselves and engaging in low-quality pleasures, either. These innocent distractions can make life more pleasurable, but at the same time a monster hides behind the innocence: developing an erroneous belief that there’s nothing wrong with exceptions.</div>
<div class="class14">An exception <span class="class11">every now and then</span>
 won’t hurt you, but when you do it regularly, it isn’t an exception anymore; it’s a habit. And that’s how people continue to drink fizzy drinks, while they said a long time ago they’d stop; how people continue spending money they don’t have, even though they vowed to make smart purchases; and how people watch TV instead of learning for their next exam.</div>
<div class="class14">“Doing it just one more time” quickly converts into another, another, and yet another exception, and soon the exception becomes <span id="calibre_link-1414"></span>
the new norm. Every time you catch yourself saying that you’re going to do it for the last time, remember that (as Steven Pressfield nicely put it), lives go down the tubes one exception at a time.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">If you depend on inspiration to act on your goals, don’t expect to achieve them quickly (if ever).</div>
<div class="class14">The only way to ensure that you consistently advance toward your objectives is to establish a routine and force inspiration upon yourself. It works in the same way as with people who always feel hunger at the same time: they’ve accustomed their bodies to eating at the same hour every day.</div>
<div class="class14">My preferred time to write is early morning. That’s when inspiration strikes me &mdash; but it’s only so because I established a routine and followed it religiously for years. Likewise, an inspiration to improve my foreign language skills strikes me at nine in the morning because that’s when I usually have language classes. Again &mdash; I don’t rely on fickle and elusive motivation; I rely on a routine.</div>
<div class="class14">You can benefit from routines when working on virtually any other goal.</div>
<div class="class14">Always exercise at the same hour, and soon you’ll train yourself to be ready for exercise at the same hour.</div>
<div class="class14">Always meditate right after waking up, and soon you’ll find yourself automatically inspired to meditate upon getting out of your bed<span id="calibre_link-1417"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Always set aside a fixed portion of your income each week or each month, and soon you won’t even think twice before sending it away to your emergency fund.</div>
<div class="class14">Making your life predictable by sticking to a set of routines might seem boring, but imagine how exciting it will be to finally accomplish your goals, thanks to following those routines! It also uses less energy when you follow the routines as a habit, so you can accomplish more with less energy, leaving you more time and energy for other things that increase your pleasure in the journey itself.</div>

<div class="class14">Sometimes weird tips can go a long way toward helping you accomplish some common goals, such as losing weight.</div>
<div class="class14">In the cited study, the size of the popcorn containers affected how much people ate from them. What’s interesting is that, even if they didn’t like popcorn, when they were eating it from a larger container, they still ate more than people who were eating from a medium-size container.</div>
<div class="class14">Conclusion? If you want to eat less, and consequently, increase your chances of success when dieting without the need for more willpower, consume in smaller containers: smaller plates, bowls, and glasses. When the plate is bigger than the food on it, it looks like there’s less food than when it’s a small plate filled to the brim with a smaller amount of food.</div>
<div class="class14">As a bonus random dieting tip for today, if you’re struggling not to eat something, go and brush your teeth. For some strange reason, brushing your teeth &mdash; at least in my experience &mdash; makes you less likely to indulge, probably because you don’t want to lose the freshness you now feel in your mouth (plus things don’t taste well <span id="calibre_link-1420"></span>
immediately after brushing your teeth, so it gives you time to pause and think before you cheat).</div>

<span id="calibre_link-242"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-241" class="class23">105</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Think of the difference between having run the first 5 miles (or kilometers) out of 25 and having just taken the first steps of a 5-mile or 5-km run. Even though they’re so similar, according to bestselling authors Chip and Dan Heath, people are more motivated when they’re facing the first option.</div>
<div class="class14">Based on my own observations, I think the main reason for their findings is that people usually find it difficult to start something challenging, so if they can get past the first barrier and are partway there (with some achievements under their belt), they’re fired up to continue.</div>
<div class="class14">You can benefit from this observation by moving yourself closer to the finish line &mdash; yes, even if you’ve just set a new goal for yourself. The idea is to fool yourself that you’re actually somewhere along into the journey, and not just about to start it &mdash; a proposition many people find so discouraging that they don’t even begin.</div>
<div class="class14">How do you do it? If you want to build a financial emergency fund, you can convince yourself that you’re already on the right track because you have some source of income (while others have to find it first), or if not, that you have some things you can sell that are <span id="calibre_link-1422"></span>
actually just money waiting to be converted into physical cash (you surely have something you could sell, so this always works). Just like that, you’re no longer just getting started with the goal &mdash; you’re already partly finished.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s go with another example. Imagine you want to have a flat stomach or become more muscular. You’re already partly finished with this goal when you can perform basic bodyweight exercises (people who can’t need to learn them first), if you’ve read some articles or books about exercise (people who haven’t have to educate themselves first), or if you have fit friends and support (others need to find it first), etc.</div>
<div class="class14">Whatever your starting point is, think of what you already have or what you’ve already accomplished and use it as a way of seeing that you’re closer to the finish line than you thought.</div>

<div class="class20">Nothing important comes into being overnight; even grapes or figs need time to ripen. If you say that you want a fig now, I will tell you to be patient. First, you must allow the tree to flower, then put forth fruit; then you have to wait until the fruit is ripe. So if the fruit of a fig tree is not brought to maturity instantly or in an hour, how do you expect the human mind to come to fruition, so quickly and easily?&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s a rule everybody would be wise to remember: don’t expect to change the negative habits you’ve been engaging in for years over the course of a few days or even a few weeks. Mindset changes &mdash; in both positive and negative directions &mdash; take time to develop.</div>
<div class="class14">At the very least, it will take you months or even years to eradicate negative habits and traits from your life. Getting angry at the timeline is futile because you can’t change the past. All you can do now is do your best to stay faithful to your new resolutions and be patient.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re starting from zero, without a vice you first need to get rid of, it will obviously take you less time to acquire the virtue you’re seeking, as you don’t have to reverse the negative effects of the vice. Even so, it doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to implement a permanent change overnight<span id="calibre_link-1425"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Just as it takes time for fruit to ripen, so it takes time for a mindset to mature. A new trait or habit only becomes firmly ingrained in your identity with the passage of time and a growing number of experiences that reinforce it.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of it as learning how to play basketball. No matter how much talent you have, you still need to take thousands upon thousands of shots to build muscle memory and develop a sixth sense for shooting the ball. Since you can’t shoot hoops 24/7, it usually takes years to become a great player, and there’s no way to shortcut the process.</div>
<div class="class14">Mindset changes are the same. One successful shot doesn’t make you a great basketball player. A consistent series of successful shots does &mdash; and for something to be considered consistent, it needs to be repeated over a long period of time.</div>

<div class="class14">Self-licensing, also known as moral licensing, is a phenomenon in which doing something good makes you more likely to do something bad. This irrational behavior is visible in many walks of life, including political correctness, prosocial behavior, and consumer choice.</div>
<div class="class14">Being aware of this danger and remaining vigilant when it’s most likely to manifest can help you avoid it. Basically, it comes down to monitoring your actions when a good behavior inflates your ego (say, you resisted a temptation to eat a piece of cake at work), or when you’re telling yourself that you’ve earned the right to indulge yourself, just because you did something you consider good for your goals.</div>
<div class="class14">Here are several situations in which self-licensing can rear its ugly head:</div>
<div class="class14">- seeing a great deal when shopping and thinking that, since you’re going to save so much money, it’s intelligent to buy it (but you don’t realize that you don’t actually need it),</div>
<div class="class14">- going through an aisle with healthy food and buying something with a “healthy” label, and then proceeding to buy some sweets <span id="calibre_link-1428"></span>
because, after all, you’re eating healthy, so why not indulge yourself every now and then?</div>

<div class="class14">Telling yourself that you don’t have time to exercise means that <span class="class11">nothing</span>
 that you have in your schedule is less important than your health.

<div class="class14">I strongly suggest eliminating the phrase “I don’t have time” from your vocabulary. People repeat it so often and so freely that it only serves as a convenient excuse &mdash; and self-disciplined individuals shouldn’t make any excuses.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you want to claim that you don’t have time, tell yourself instead that it’s not your priority.

<div class="class14">Being obsessed about the outcome can help you achieve it more quickly, but it carries the risk of achieving unsustainable results, or worse, ruining your life in the process by taking the low road.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, consider a person who wants to build a successful business. Their end goal &mdash; making a million dollars &mdash; is more important than anything else. They don’t care about the why or how; it’s only money that counts. Whenever there’s an opportunity to make money, even if it’s unethical, they’ll take it. After all, the end justifies the means, right?</div>
<div class="class14">Taking the low road is yet another temptation you must battle on your journey toward success. There’s no glory in building a business the unethical way, ruining your body with an unsustainable, unhealthy diet just to be slim, or ruining your body forever by taking steroids and other unsafe medications just to become more muscular.</div>
<div class="class14">One way to prevent this from happening is to always think of something bigger than an extrinsic reward as a source of motivation.

<div class="class14">“Free” is the ultimate marketing method, and it’s also the one that can do the greatest damage to your resolutions, primarily those of the financial and fitness kind.</div>
<div class="class14">From now on, whenever you see that something is free and you want to act on it, ask yourself whether you really need it. If you were to pay for it, would you still want it or do you want it simply because you don’t want to miss out on a freebie?</div>
<div class="class14">The first practical application is for people who are on a diet and gorge on food whenever they find themselves at a party with free snacks. What are you gaining by eating all this food and what are you losing? Unless food is scarce in your world (and it probably isn’t if you’re on a diet), the only thing that you’re gaining is avoiding the fear of missing out. And what are you losing? Your dream, your hard work until now, and possibly your future. Are the free snacks worth it?</div>
<div class="class14">The second application is for people who want to exert more self-control when it comes to their finances. When shopping, if there’s a deal where you can get one thing for free, ask yourself <span id="calibre_link-1442"></span>
whether you’d pay for this thing if it weren’t offered for free and if you’re really going to have a use for it. If not, what’s so special about this deal? It might be a deal to someone who would buy the thing on sale anyway, but it isn’t for you.</div>
<div class="class14">There’s nothing you’re losing out on if you don’t purchase something that has no use for you. And if you do buy it, you’re losing a lot: your money, space in your house, time needed to maintain it, etc.</div>

<div class="class14">In today’s world of abundance, there’s always the next hot thing, a new miracle solution, a cure for it all. It’s no wonder that so many people lack the self-discipline to stick to one thing and constantly jump from one thing to another, deluding themselves that the new thing will surely be better than the one they have now.</div>
<div class="class14">If we think of pursuing your goals as being in the business of breeding chickens, how big will your fowl empire get if you constantly smash all of the eggs you have, thinking that those other eggs you’ve seen online will hatch more quickly?</div>
<div class="class14">In essence, that’s what a person is doing when they are constantly changing their mind. An important aspect of self-discipline is the discipline to stick to the specific strategies you’ve chosen to follow, in order to get the results.</div>
<div class="class14">If the strategy you’re following has been proven to work for other people (as in the case of following popular healthy diets, tested workout plans, personal finance strategies, etc.), switching out of it to another one only because you think the other one could be better is nothing but an act of self-sabotage.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently thinking about giving up your current strategy because you’re tempted to try something else, remind yourself of the metaphor with the egg. Nobody has ever accomplished anything by <span id="calibre_link-1444"></span>
constantly destroying the fruits of their labor. If your strategy has been proven to work for many people, dedicate yourself to it for at least a year before you even consider the thought of trying something else.</div>

<div class="class20">Planning a variance, make it concrete, black and white, and specify exactly when the variance will end. For example, instead of doing your regular gym routine while traveling through Europe, you commit to do twenty pushups every morning, and then as soon as you return home, resume your normal routine.</div>

<div class="class14">Things change and routines get disrupted, with travel being one of the most common culprits. Whenever I can, I try to maintain the exact same routine as I follow when I am back home. If I can’t, as Tynan suggests, I come up with an alternative that is specifically to be used during the time of the disruption.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, in a few days I’m going to travel to Cyprus, an island country in the eastern Mediterranean. I have no idea whether I’ll have access to any fitness equipment there, including something as simple as a pull-up bar.</div>
<div class="class14">Consequently, I plan to take advantage of the surroundings as much as I can to maintain my shape: swim in the sea, take long walks or run at the beach, hike in the mountains, and if I find the time, perform some simple bodyweight exercises that don’t require any kind of equipment whatsoever<span id="calibre_link-1446"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">This way, when I come back home, I won’t feel as if I’ve lost my normal routine. And I won’t &mdash; it will only be <span class="class11">altered</span>
 for the special occasion, but I’ll still perform it, and consequently, won’t run the risk of falling off the bandwagon.</div>
<div class="class14">When you know about an approaching situation that’s likely to disrupt your routine, prepare yourself beforehand. Think if there’s any way that you can maintain your routine despite that situation, and if you can’t, come up with an alternative routine modified for the special circumstances. Even if your best idea is not a great one, at least you’ll still be sticking to your routine in some way, and that will prevent you from losing it.</div>

Now it’s 8 p.m., I find it hard to focus, and I’m only beginning to write my daily word count.</div>
<div class="class14">And yet, I’m sitting here in front of my laptop and pushing myself to stick to my resolutions and yes, I’ll sit here until I get it done. Wouldn’t it be better to take it easy and just start again tomorrow? If I were sick and barely able to work, then yes.</div>
<div class="class14">However, in my case, even though I don’t feel even half as creative and mentally prepared for work as in the morning, I’m going to persist because it’s when you struggle and things aren’t quite right that you can strengthen your self-discipline the most.</div>
<div class="class14">I know that once I finish my work today &mdash; even if it takes me several hours of strenuous work in the late evening (when I’m usually asleep) &mdash; I’ll feel good, knowing that I’ve kept a promise I made to myself<span id="calibre_link-1448"></span>

<div class="class14">I strive to value the agreements I make with myself as much as the ones I make with other people. The reason is simple: just like when you lose the trust of another person when you fail to keep your promise, so you lose your trust of yourself when you don’t keep an agreement that you made with yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">Without self-trust, it’s impossible to have the self-discipline and self-confidence to achieve big goals and change your life. Your doubts will nag at you and you’ll sabotage yourself because, deep down, you’ll believe that you can’t trust yourself anyway.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you make commitments with yourself, honor them just like you honor the word you give to other people, if not more. If you frequently betray yourself, you’ll make it harder and harder to rebuild trust with yourself, and soon, it will take many months of consistent wins before you get to regain self-trust.</div>

He doesn’t have to write, and if he doesn’t feel like it, he shouldn’t try. He can look out the window or stand on his head or writhe on the floor. But he is not to do any other positive thing, not read, write letters, glance at magazines, or write checks. Either write or nothing… I find it works.

You can walk around the room, sit, look out of the window, or stare at the monitor, but you can’t do anything more exciting than that.</div>
<div class="class14">This technique gives you a license to goof off, but since you can’t do anything remotely interesting, sooner or later you’ll probably get to work. And that’s the purpose of this trick: you aren’t forcing yourself to work, and hence, there’s no resistance that you need to overcome.

<div class="class14">Research suggests that daily gratitude boosts self-control. Researcher David DeSteno says that expressing gratitude for little everyday things, such as the kindness of a stranger, functions like a vaccine against impulsiveness. It enhances self-control and makes you more oriented toward the future.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to boosting your self-control, expressing thankfulness daily makes you a more positive person, and that in itself is a huge benefit that can affect your ability to stick to your goals when the going gets tough.</div>
<div class="class14">Each morning or evening express gratitude for five small things. For example, I’m now sitting outdoors (one thing to be grateful for is our beautiful planet), enjoying sunny weather, and doing work I like. I’m grateful because I was able to spend a few hours climbing today and because (after I finish my work for the day) I’ll cook myself a tasty, healthy meal.</div>
<div class="class14">Such simple things are what makes life great. Why not regularly express your gratitude for them and become happier, develop more mental resistance, reduce impulsiveness and gain more self-control?</div>

<div class="class14">Self-denial is ultimately a self-sabotaging strategy. By telling yourself that you don’t have anything to worry about, you might feel better temporarily, but the flaws and weaknesses don’t go away. You’re missing out on the opportunity to overcome them.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Doing a two-month challenge of only taking cold showers was one of my first deliberate endeavors to improve my self-control. Unlike other goals that I pursued for the specific benefits that they would give me, my cold shower challenge was primarily about testing myself.</div>
<div class="class14">During those two months, I learned a great deal about how to overcome temptations and how my own mechanisms of self-control work (and when they cease to function).</div>
<div class="class14">I strongly recommend taking up a similar challenge to push your limits and toughen up. Is an entire month or two necessary to benefit from this exercise? Not really. Even just a few cold showers can be valuable lessons that will strengthen your self-control. Willingly exposing yourself to such a torture is something very few people are capable of doing, so this in itself is a great accomplishment.</div>
<div class="class14">If your health doesn’t allow you to take cold showers (and as a side note, please note that you should always speak with your doctor <span id="calibre_link-1457"></span>
before making any decisions of such a nature), try other ways of cold exposure.</div>
<div class="class14">Underdress in cold weather, submerge the lower part of your body in a cold bath, or turn your thermostat down. Voluntarily exposing yourself to the discomfort you feel when you’re cold, no matter if it’s a cold shower or something less extreme, will still be an excellent way to improve your impulse control and become tougher.</div>

<div class="class14">For example, I have ten fundamental rules that guide my overall life and many more that I apply to different aspects of my life. Here are three examples of my general principles that are applicable to every endeavor:</div>
<div class="class14">1. I never give up on anything that’s important to me.</div>
<div class="class14">2. Time is my most important asset. I always focus on achieving more in less time.</div>
<div class="class14">3. Growth happens outside one’s comfort zone. Security leads to mediocrity.</div>
<div class="class14">These rules ensure that I live my life according to my most important values and help me avoid making decisions that favor instant gratification.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, following the first rule means that if I establish that something is important to me, I won’t give up on it, no matter what. Embracing the second rule means that I resist the temptation to do things mindlessly and always seek a more effective way of doing something. Living by the third rule means that I face my fears and <span id="calibre_link-1460"></span>
resist the urge to stay complacent. This way, I’m always growing and reduce the risk of becoming too comfortable.</div>
<div class="class14">These are not just mere words &mdash; I consider them as important as promises made to somebody else, so I need to fulfill them. What rules do you want to embrace in your own life?

I dabbled into different marketing methods, but in the end had to limit my focus to only the few things that offered the greatest benefit. Doing everything would have perhaps portrayed me as a more hard-working author, but it wouldn’t increase my effectiveness, and most likely would only reduce it.</div>
<div class="class14">Restlessness can be a good thing to inspire a person to take action, but if it leads to mindless work for the sake of work, you’re wasting your potential and resources you could have spent on another area of life where increased effort would have led to noticeable improvements.</div>

<div class="class14">The way you look at what self-discipline is can affect how self-disciplined you are. If you think of self-discipline as <span class="class11">punishing</span>
 yourself in return for some possible benefits in the future, how likely are you going to be eager to maintain it in your life?</div>
<div class="class14">Instead, what if you embraced self-discipline as self-caring, a way of manifesting that your time is valuable to you and that you want to make the most of it?</div>
<div class="class14">Now, instead of seeing every temptation as something pleasant that you must avoid for the possible future benefit, you’d look at it as a threat to your well-being. For example, upon adopting this outlook on life, you’d understand on a deeper level that watching TV for hours on end is not entertainment; it’s killing your valuable time, and in the case of low-quality TV, killing your brain cells.</div>
<div class="class14">And the other way around: things that you currently consider torturous (such as waking up early, eating vegetables, saving money, expanding your comfort zone, and so on) would all become manifestations of self-care. You’d understand on a deeper level that waking up early makes you more productive, and consequently, creates more time and energy for you &mdash; even if it isn’t always fun.</div>

<div class="class14">If there exists a “hack” for quickly embracing self-discipline as a part of your identity, it’s clearly communicating to everyone around you how important this value is for you &mdash; and then taking actions that are congruent with that decision.</div>
<div class="class14">The key is to maintain that behavior both when you are around other people and also when you’re alone &mdash; we’re not talking about faking it in public. The beautiful part is that when others associate you with a certain positive trait, you’ll want to maintain it.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of a child who’s considered to be tough by other kids. The next time he or she scrapes his or her knee, will he or she cry or try to remain congruent with his or her public image and walk it off? Obviously, we’re adults now, but the basic premise doesn’t change: humans need to stay congruent, particularly around other people.</div>
<div class="class14">All of my friends know that I’m a bit of a freak when it comes to self-discipline (okay, not a <span class="class11">bit of a freak</span>
, I <span class="class11">am</span>
 a freak about that!) and consequently, this form of conduct is pretty much forced on me. I don’t want to be incongruent with myself and I don’t want other people to think that I’m saying one thing and doing another<span id="calibre_link-1473"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if there’s a challenge in front of me and I know that my friend is thinking that I’m going to face it instead of quitting, I’ll face it (obviously only after I ensure that it’s relatively safe).</div>
<div class="class14">Then, when I’m alone dealing with a self-imposed challenge, I’ll be less likely to give up, too &mdash; after all, I don’t want to lose the respect I have for myself, and most certainly don’t want my friends to be disappointed in me upon learning that I’m a different person around them and a different person when I’m by myself.</div>

<div class="class20">Skipping around from one kind of pursuit to another: grit is about working on something you care about so much that you’re willing to stay loyal to it. Not just falling in love &mdash; staying in love.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-23"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-22" class="class23">129</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">It’s easy to fall in love, but hard to stay in love, particularly when the waters get rough. It takes constant recommitment, sacrifice, and a willingness to deeply care for what you already have. In a sense, falling in love is like immediate gratification, giving you butterflies and all that jazz without any unpleasantries, while staying in love (although it’s rewarding in the long run) is sometimes an act of sacrifice that requires a great deal of self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">When you set your goals, do you tend to stick to them for the long haul, or do you let the temptation to change things decide for you?</div>
<div class="class14">If you constantly jump from one thing to another, perhaps you don’t care about your goals enough to stay loyal to them. Ask yourself if that’s the case, and if so, how you can find new, stronger motivators or if perhaps you should give up altogether.</div>
<div class="class14">If it happens with every objective of yours, even when you deeply care about it (like it was for me when I was constantly launching one business after another), it’s probably not a question of <span id="calibre_link-1475"></span>
not caring enough, but about a failure to exert self-control when faced with the shiny object syndrome.</div>
<div class="class14">The shiny object syndrome is the inability to maintain focus on one thing, mistakenly believing that the grass is greener on the other side. Instead of investing all of your resources in just one thing (for example, a specific relationship, business, diet, etc.), you constantly replace the thing you have now with something else, just because it’s new and shiny. What you fail to realize, though, is that by constantly “upgrading,” you never get to build something that lasts, so you fail to achieve your long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you find yourself researching a new diet, workout plan, business model, way to save money, technique to stay productive, and so on, remind yourself that unless your approach is clearly not working at all (and for that, you need to stick to it in the long term), all you’re doing is falling under the spell of instant gratification that will endanger your long-term goal .</div>

That might bother some people but it doesn’t bother me. I enjoy the cottage cheese. I enjoy it more than I would those cookies because I know it will help me do what makes me happy.

<div class="class14">If something makes you extremely happy, the desire to do it as much as you can will replace or at least greatly diminish the need for self-discipline. Obviously, the thing that you love must be good for you &mdash; eating French fries may make you extremely happy, but devoting your life to them won’t be a good idea.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, in my case, one of the things that currently determines many of my choices and replaces the need for self-discipline is rock climbing. It’s the number one reason why I perform hard bodyweight workouts (to be stronger to climb better), why I maintain low weight (because it’s easier to climb if you weigh <span id="calibre_link-1477"></span>
less), why I constantly expand my comfort zone (because it improves my mental game when I’m climbing), and so on.</div>
<div class="class14">The thing that makes you happy doesn’t have to be a sport, but it does need to have a positive influence on you.</div>
<div class="class14">If you already have such a big passion in your life, link it to your new resolutions. There’s always a way to combine a positive change with an improved ability to engage in your passion (for example, eating better will make you more energetic, which will make you better at everything you’re doing, including your passion), so tap into this resource and let your desire to engage in your passion render self-discipline unnecessary.</div>

 getting your reward; you just need to wait ten minutes.</div>
<div class="class14">A curious fact is that after ten minutes, it’s likely that you’ll no longer remember the craving or it will have diminished to such a level that you’ll be able to handle it. And if not, you can tell yourself yet again that you’ll have it in ten minutes and repeat the process until the urge is gone.</div>
<div class="class14">If you find the urge overpowering, use a stopwatch and stare at it the entire ten minutes before succumbing to the temptation. After ten minutes, even if you still reward yourself, at least you’ll have exercised your self-control muscle a little.</div>
<div class="class14">Note that you can wait for ten minutes for any temptation in both directions: either by waiting for 10 minutes before you give in to something, or by giving yourself 10 minutes to do something and then allowing yourself to stop.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re facing the challenge of unpleasant, but necessary and urgent work to do, tell yourself that you’ll only do it for ten minutes and then you can quit. More often than not, you’ll <span id="calibre_link-1479"></span>
continue. And if not, as with waiting for 10 minutes before giving in to a temptation, you’ll still have exercised your willpower.</div>

<div class="class20">(…) the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">The ability to thrive in low-stimuli environments, such as when working without distractions, is one of the most powerful demonstrations of self-control. Sadly, most people don’t possess it, because they have developed a habit of constantly interrupting their focus with low-value, highly-stimulating activities, such as browsing social media or shopping online.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re unable to tolerate an absence of novelty, you’ll be unable to focus on anything for long enough to see it through to the end. Therefore, it’s key to develop the willpower to resist the temptation to entertain yourself when things get boring or too challenging for your mind.</div>
<div class="class14">I suggest a simple practice: follow the Pomodoro technique of time management in which you work for 25 minutes and then give yourself 5 minutes to distract yourself with whatever you want. Once the 5 minutes are up, you have to get back to work, and after 25 minutes more of work, you can yet again let yourself enjoy high-stimuli, low-value activities for 5 minutes<span id="calibre_link-1482"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">The Pomodoro technique works so well because it doesn’t force people to exert incredible amounts of willpower. It’s only 25 minutes of work, so even if you’re usually interrupting work every 10 minutes, you’ll only need to wait for 15 minutes more before you can indulge.</div>
<div class="class14">After following this technique for several weeks or months, you should notice an improvement in the quality of your work. Soon, 25 minutes of highly-focused work will no longer be a challenge for you, and you’ll greatly strengthen your self-control.</div>

<div class="class14">If you’re often late, realize that being late to an appointment doesn’t differ from breaking a promise; it’s still an act that can cost you the trust of another person.

 or when you’ve <span class="class11">earned it</span>
. Making your life revolve around comfort and laziness doesn’t lead to happiness in the long term; it leads to depression. Taking action and exerting yourself rarely feels good <span class="class11">at first</span>
, but upon completing valuable work, the pleasure of sleeping in can hardly match the pleasure of being productive.</div>
<div class="class14">The most powerful proof of the fact that human beings cannot thrive if they don’t act and exert themselves is the research on retirement.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, according to a report published by the Institute of Economic Affairs in association with the Age Endeavour Fellowship, retirement increases your risk of clinical depression by 41% <span id="calibre_link-1492"></span>
and the probability of having at least one diagnosed physical condition by 63%.<span id="calibre_link-257"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-256" class="class25">139</a>
 What’s more, the adverse effects increase as the number of years spent in retirement increases.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, the effect of retirement depends on how the retired person approaches retirement. Sadly, when facing a new reality in which they no longer have to work, a lot of people stop being active and disengage from life &mdash; and that’s what leads to the disturbing findings of the study. The ones who feel that their golden years are indeed golden are the ones who continue to be active, whether it’s helping their families, volunteering, working part time, or embracing new hobbies.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you find yourself discouraged, remind yourself that while succumbing to laziness feels good at first, ultimately it will only worsen your situation and make you even less ready to face challenges.

<div class="class20">I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.</div>

<div class="class14">Not making a decision is also a decision, and usually the worst one. While you’re torn between one choice and another, you’re losing time you could have spent taking action &mdash; any action &mdash; and then figuring out whether it was the right choice or not.</div>
<div class="class14">People often decide to not decide, or they put off their decisions because of a fear of missing out. Choosing one thing means <span class="class11">not</span>
 choosing another. However, not choosing either of them means losing both.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s also tempting to avoid making a decision because it creates an illusion that you still have the freedom to choose. And while it’s true that you <span class="class11">do</span>
 retain this freedom, there’s <span class="class11">more</span>
 freedom in commitment, as it frees you from inertia and gets you closer to determining where you want to go.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re hesitant about whether you want to pursue a certain goal or not, figure out a low-investment way to get started. You can’t get much additional insight by waiting for an excessive period of time, while you can gain an immense amount of knowledge by going ahead and testing the waters.</div>

<div class="class20">Far too often we let little things slide. But just turn on the news and listen as the anchors lament an auto-part defect leading to deaths and multibillion-dollar recalls or a small leak in a gas pipeline causing an explosion that endangers wildlife. Recognizing when something is wrong, big or small, and holding people accountable can save industries billions and citizens their lives. Sergeant Bowen instilled in me instantly that if you do walk by a mistake, then you just set a new, lower standard.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">When you make an unimportant mistake, there’s a temptation to let it go and ignore it. After all, it isn’t a big deal, so why bother? If your dishes aren’t pristinely clean, it won’t change much in the grand scheme of things, and most certainly won’t hurt anybody.</div>
<div class="class14">The problem is that walking by your mistakes sets a precedent of tolerating small errors. You’re also missing out on a valuable exercise in self-control: making sure that all that you do is done with the utmost care.</div>
<div class="class14">I’m the last person to say that from now on you need to make sure that everything that you do is flawless. I’m fully aware that it isn’t feasible, and I’d be a hypocrite to say that; my favorite tea mug is never entirely free of tea stains!</div>
<div class="class14">However, whenever you can, try to exercise a little bit of self-control and correct a little thing that you consider unimportant. It can be a small tweak in your posture, making sure that you sit properly <span id="calibre_link-1497"></span>
in front of the computer. It can be making an effort to speak more clearly and improve your articulation. It can be ensuring that your bed is made properly or slicing a loaf of bread with more precision.</div>
<div class="class14">I often spend several minutes trying to fix a paragraph that I don’t consider up to my standards. In the grand scheme of things, one single paragraph doesn’t mean much. However, when the little things are repeated over and over again, it does have an effect on the final outcome and carries the risk of establishing a precedent &mdash; in this case, of my being lazy with my writing.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Many put off acting on their goals because they’re afraid. Instead of facing the challenge head on, they choose a more comfortable option: withdrawing until they gain the courage to take action.</div>
<div class="class14">The sad truth is that courage never appears out of the blue, magically manifesting itself if you only wait long enough. Brave people aren’t immune to fear; they also feel it, but decide to act in spite of it. And in this very act of refusal, fear goes away and they get to do incredible things.</div>
<div class="class14">As a rock climber, fear is my regular companion. Fear makes you question whether you can climb a particular route, or when climbing, makes you back out from a challenge.</div>
<div class="class14">While fear <span class="class11">does</span>
 serve an important purpose in situations like climbing, when there sometimes <span class="class11">is</span>
 a risk of injuring or killing yourself, it’s often a wrong counselor. The key is to ask yourself one fundamental question:</div>
<div class="class14">Is there a statistically-significant chance of harming myself?</div>
<div class="class14">In climbing, a potential fall is often safe, so any fear that makes you question your abilities is unfounded. If a fall is safe, you might as well try and fall; nothing bad will happen. However, sometimes <span id="calibre_link-1499"></span>
the decision to continue climbing needs to be carefully calculated, especially when a potential fall can be dangerous. Then fear can actually save your life.</div>
<div class="class14">However, in most everyday applications, fear is unfounded. There’s almost no risk involved in chatting up that attractive stranger, launching a side business on a shoestring, applying for a new job, starting a diet, or implementing any other change of a similar nature.</div>
<div class="class14">This means that unless you’re engaging in any higher-risk activity, you need to go past your fear. I know &mdash; it’s not pleasant, it’s paralyzing, it causes so much pressure that all you want to do is get away from it. However, if you want to strengthen your self-discipline and build mental toughness, there’s no better exercise than to repeatedly face your fears.</div>
<div class="class14">By regularly facing my fear of heights, I was able to largely cure myself of it. If I were continuously avoiding it, hoping that one day the fear would disappear by itself, I’d never have become a rock climber.</div>

Your Armor</div>
<div class="class20">The individual can attain self-control in great things only through self-control in little things. He must study himself to discover what is the weak point in his armor, what is the element within him that ever keeps him from his fullest success. This is the characteristic upon which he should begin his exercise in self-control. Is it selfishness, vanity, cowardice, morbidness, temper, laziness, worry, mind-wandering, lack of purpose? &mdash; whatever form human weakness assumes in the masquerade of life he must discover.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Inspect your armor and find its weakest point, the common thread that leads you into most temptations or poses the biggest barrier to achieving your goals.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, in my case, one of my weakest points is patience. If I do something, I want to go all out and get results as quickly as possible. While it often serves as a strength, it’s also a common reason why I fail to achieve some of my goals.</div>
<div class="class14">I follow rigid routines and am sometimes so strict with myself that eventually I can no longer continue because I burn myself out. What follows is a full-blown cheat day (after following too strict of a diet), an inability to write (after writing too much for too long), or an injury (after exercising too hard).</div>
<div class="class14">My inability to be patient with the process was also one of the reasons why I failed to build a profitable business for several years. <span id="calibre_link-1502"></span>
Instead of accepting the fact that all businesses need the owner’s undivided focus for a long period of time, I constantly launched one business after another, thinking each time that the new business model would surely provide a breakthrough.</div>
<div class="class14">Having discovered my weak point, when setting new goals I now focus on sustainability. I try to accept the fact that it’s better to take the longer path with fewer pitfalls than choose the quick route with a high chance of failure or delude myself by thinking that switching my strategy (for no reason) will lead to success.</div>
<div class="class14">What are your own weak points? How do they affect your goals and what can you do to fix those weaknesses, to prevent them from continuing to affect your life in a negative way?</div>

<div class="class20">It’s this great paradox that only a few people understand, but ultra-performers have realized that procrastination and indulgence are like these creditors that charge us interest.

<div class="class14">Metaphors can serve as useful tools to better understand and embrace concepts that otherwise don’t produce an emotional effect.</div>
<div class="class14">If I tell you that putting things off and indulging yourself affect you negatively in the long term, perhaps you’ll agree with me and stay away from them. Or perhaps you’ll ignore me, because the statement in itself isn’t emotionally-charged and memorable.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead, what if you embraced the metaphor that procrastination and indulgence are like your creditors? They extend you some credit today, but don’t fool yourself &mdash; they <span class="class11">will</span>
 be back, asking you to give the money back along with interest.</div>
<div class="class14">The more you overeat today, the more time you’ll have to spend in the future in a caloric deficit. A cake today is so tasty and nice to have, but don’t let it fool you &mdash; under the friendly face hides a ruthless banker.</div>

Character</div>
<div class="class20">If you make disciplined, caring choices, you are slowly engraving certain tendencies into your mind. You are making it more likely that you will desire the right things and execute the right actions. If you make selfish, cruel, or disorganized choices, then you are slowly turning this core thing inside yourself into something that is degraded, inconstant, or fragmented.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-960"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-917" class="class23">146</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">If you currently don’t see yourself as a self-disciplined person and your desires and actions prioritize instant gratification over sacrifices that lead to bigger rewards in the future, you may feel as if there’s no way you’ll ever change. After all, it’s been your way of doing things for a long time, and it’s probably already part of your nature now.</div>
<div class="class14">Fortunately, while your character takes time to change, it <span class="class11">is</span>
 possible to change it &mdash; with thousands of little decisions and by embracing certain thoughts over others.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, today you may not have a tendency to desire healthy food, but rest assured that if you eat it for long enough, you <span class="class11">will</span>
 develop a desire for it.</div>
<div class="class14">I’m speaking from my own experience; initially I couldn’t stand the taste of many vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or cauliflower. As for the other vegetables, I was neutral about most of them, which meant that &mdash; given a choice between eating vegetables <span id="calibre_link-1508"></span>
and something else, I’d go for something else. Today, I often crave vegetables. I no longer need to force myself to eat them. A tendency to consume them regularly is now a part of my character.</div>
<div class="class14">This little example is only one change that was engraved in my mind after making disciplined choices over and over again. No matter which area of your life you are talking about, what now feels like a difficult act of deprivation or a sacrifice will eventually turn into something you consider essential in your life.</div>

<div class="class14">Alternatively, think of any purchase as hours of your work. 50 bucks is just a number that has little, if any, emotional charge. How about two or three hours of your life? Would you buy this new trinket with two or three hours of your time, instead of paying with a $50 bill? What if it’s actually the same thing as losing fifteen hours of your life over the long run? Is it still worth it?</div>

<div class="class20">As he walked across the farmyard toward the hen house, he noticed the pump was leaking. So he stopped to fix it. It needed a new washer, so he set off to the barn to get one. But on the way he saw that the hayloft needed straightening, so he went to fetch the pitchfork. Hanging next to the pitchfork was a broom with a broken handle. “I must make a note to myself to buy a broom handle the next time I get to town,” he thought…</div>
<div class="class26">By now it is clear that the farmer is not going to get his eggs gathered, nor is he likely to accomplish anything else he sets out to do. He is utterly, gloriously spontaneous, but he is hardly free. He is, if anything, a prisoner to his unbridled spontaneity. The fact of the matter is that discipline is the only way to freedom; it is the necessary context for spontaneity.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-993"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-984" class="class23">148</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">When you think of spontaneity, you might think of it as something positive and fun. Going on an unplanned road trip. Dancing in the rain. Saying yes to random invitations.</div>
<div class="class14">Spontaneity can be positive, as long as you don’t mistake it with impulsiveness. Whenever you justify your uninhibited behaviors with spontaneity, ask yourself if that’s what it really is or whether your unplanned actions are in reality caused by a lack of self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">Another danger you need to be aware of is when people use spontaneity to lure you in to betray your resolutions. For example, imagine you’re on a diet. When you’re out having fun with your friends, at midnight suddenly one of them announces that you’re all going to go get some pizza. If you back out, you may be called uptight or a killjoy<span id="calibre_link-1511"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">At that moment, it’s important to realize that your friend’s accusations are unfounded because they mistake disinhibition with spontaneity. You can still be spontaneous without ruining your goals. For example, instead of eating a pizza, you can eat something less caloric (like a salad), eat just one or two small slices, or if you decide to eat the entire pizza, schedule a strenuous workout the next day (or reduce your caloric intake for a day) to burn off the excess calories.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re wondering if self-discipline is going to make you a boring person, realize that you <span class="class11">can</span>
 make an exception from time to time &mdash; just don’t do it when you’re being pressured into doing it.<br class="calibre" />

Division of labor has led to prosperity, but it has also made us lazy: whatever you want, you can buy it and get it almost instantly delivered to your door.</div>
<div class="class14">Have a backyard? Hire a gardener to tend to it. Don’t want to clean? Hire a maid. Don’t have the patience to learn how to fix your sink? Call a handyman.</div>
<div class="class14">There’s nothing inherently wrong about it and in fact, more often than not it’s a smart approach. Why waste time doing something you’re not good at if there are people who would be happy to take care of the problem for you?</div>
<div class="class14">However, if you develop a habit that whenever you’re facing a problem, you need to call somebody else to fix it, what will happen to your problem-solving skills? How likely will you be to keep going when problems emerge in your line of work and it will be you who will need to deal with them<span id="calibre_link-1513"></span>

<div class="class14">However, even though I could afford it, in the end I decided against it, realizing that in addition to financial savings, it was a good opportunity to learn something new. Remodeling can be a frustrating and difficult undertaking, so it can also serve as a valuable exercise in self-control.

.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, rock climbing has taught me the value of taking things one step at a time. When climbing a difficult route, you focus only on the next handhold or foothold. You slowly advance, with your vision limited to the immediate surroundings. The same approach is effective when working on your goals &mdash; instead of worrying whether you get to the top, you focus on what’s right in front of you.</div>
<div class="class14">The experience and skills I gained when climbing are now useful to me in every other sport, and thanks to that, I can learn them more quickly.</div>
<div class="class14">On a completely unrelated note, the experience of off-road driving has taught me the power of momentum. It’s difficult to gain traction with nothing but sand under your wheels, but once you start, you can traverse difficult terrain. If you stop, it will be hard to start yet again. I don’t think I need to tell you how much that applies to the world of personal development.</div>

<div class="class14">In addition to daily fasts of 16 to 20 hours, I sometimes fast for 40 hours or more. When you fast for such a long time, your senses are heightened. Smells are more intense and flavors more explosive.</div>
<div class="class14">In this state, you learn to want things you already have. A simple apple tastes like heaven and is more than sufficient as a food source. I don’t need an apple pie, a caramelized apple sprinkled with cinnamon, or apple pancakes covered with apple-horseradish sauce.</div>
<div class="class14">You can persuade yourself to want the things you have by abstaining from them for a period of time or imagining they’re no longer available for you.

<div class="class14">Whatever problems you’re facing today, somebody has already faced them in the past. Perhaps not in the exact same way as you, but close enough that the story of this person will resonate with you.</div>
<div class="class14">That’s why I find biographies (particularly autobiographies) so inspirational &mdash; you’re getting to know the stories of great individuals and discover that no matter what period of history they took place in, people always employed the same or similar ways to achieve success. What’s so powerful about it is that you can apply their lessons in your own life and have a reasonable chance that if it worked for them, it will work for you.</div>
<div class="class14">It might sound like I’m opposed to the use of self-help literature (obviously I’m not; otherwise I wouldn’t write my books!), but I strongly believe that you’re often better served by reading biographies of people you want to emulate, rather than yet another generic book about personal development. (And yes, you have my <span id="calibre_link-1520"></span>
blessing to close this book now, if you have a good biography waiting for you on the bookshelf!)</div>

<div class="class20">Always have options. Options are a primary source of power.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-1086" class="class23">154</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s an easy way to sabotage yourself: limit your thinking to black or white. It’s either A or B. You either do it or you don’t. Having only two options takes away your power to choose and makes you susceptible to decision avoidance. This, in turn, makes you less likely to introduce important changes in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">Rarely, if ever, are there only two options.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, let’s imagine you’re now working 9 to 5, but you’d like to become an entrepreneur. Black or white thinking makes you believe that you only have two options: keep your job or give notice and start your business. With only two (opposite) directions to choose from, you can’t make it any harder for you to decide.</div>
<div class="class14">What about continuing your career while building a side business? How about asking your boss if you can work from your home office? What about changing your form of employment to become a contractor instead of an employee? What about finding a job in a startup that is looking for a cofounder with your experience?</div>
<div class="class14">Suddenly you have other options, and those options can empower you to introduce a change instead of having to choose between the status quo and making an irresponsible decision.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you catch yourself thinking that you only have two options, think again. Black-or-white thinking is mental laziness. <span id="calibre_link-1523"></span>
Always find at least one more alternative and give yourself a better chance of making the right decision.</div>

e</div>
<div class="class20">Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we’re good at, we insistently seek out what we’re not good at. Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those things over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see &mdash; or get others to tell us &mdash; exactly what still isn’t right so we can repeat the most painful and difficult parts of what we’ve just done.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-106" class="class23">155</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Concentrating on what you aren’t good at instead of exclusively doing what you do well can dramatically speed up your progress rate, particularly in a complex endeavor that has many moving pieces.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s tempting to stick to doing what you’re good at and ignore the rest. It feels enjoyable, and if it’s a skill you can show off to others, that’s another reason to stick to what you do well. However, ultimately you can find little growth in repeating (over and over again) what you’ve already mastered, while other aspects of your performance leave something to be desired.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, in rock climbing one of my weaknesses is climbing routes that rely heavily on finger strength. I could choose to ignore any routes of this nature, but doing so would mean dramatically slowing down my progress, if not bringing it to a halt. Even though it gives me great pleasure to climb routes with easier handholds and climbing the ones requiring finger strength is often a nightmare, I <span id="calibre_link-1526"></span>
know that ultimately, it’s the <span class="class11">uncomfortable</span>
 routes that will make me a better climber.</div>
<div class="class14">Focusing on your strengths and ignoring or bypassing what you aren’t good at is a form of instant gratification. Meanwhile, identifying the painful, difficult activities that will address your weaknesses requires sacrifice, but ultimately leads to bigger rewards in the future. Go with the latter.</div>

<div class="class14">Learning can’t happen if you believe that improvement is beyond your control. Yet, that’s precisely what you’re doing when you’re pointing the finger at yourself instead of at a specific action that you took.</div>
<div class="class14">Imagine an instructor who tells their student that they’re a terrible tennis player. What does such kind of feedback accomplish besides demotivating the student? The only effective way to teach is to deliver specific feedback pertaining to a concrete aspect of their game, not by criticizing the person playing it.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Cognitive reframing is a process in which you change the meaning of a difficulty, hardship, or failure and give it a positive slant.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you were injured during a workout, you can think of it as the worst thing that could have happened to you or you can reframe it by looking at it as an opportunity to recharge and focus on performing the exercise more safely in the future, perhaps preventing an even worse injury by doing so.</div>
<div class="class14">If you cheated while on a diet, you can think of it as a stupid move on your part. However, it would be better to look at it as a lesson by asking yourself why, where, and when it happened, and what you can do to avoid doing it again in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re ready to take cognitive reframing to the extreme (and I strongly recommend you do so), develop what Brian Tracy calls “inverse paranoia”: the belief that the world is conspiring to do you good and that everything that happens to you contributes to your success<span id="calibre_link-1529"></span>

<div class="class14">Living with such a mindset not only makes you happier. It also makes you more mentally resilient (because you know that everything happens for a good reason) and consequently, less likely to become discouraged and give up.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-226" class="class23">158</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Anger is one of the most infectious emotions. When somebody attacks them verbally, for many people the urge to offer a nasty, angry comeback is so overpowering that they do it automatically. Before you know it, you’re engaged in a verbal fight. Working on controlling your anger can provide great benefits when it comes to strengthening your impulse control.</div>
<div class="class14">Every time somebody attacks you, resist the temptation to engage in a fight by either finding something funny about the situation, deflecting the attack (for example by thanking the attacker for expressing their opinion, which might then strike you as humorous), or if those are not possible, walking away from the situation.</div>
<div class="class14">Remember that in the grand scheme of things you gain nothing &mdash; and risk a lot &mdash; by responding with a fiery comeback. As good as venting feels at that moment, losing your temper is not worth it when you consider the potential longer-term cost, such as losing your job, your reputation, a key relationship, or even just ruining your mood for the entire day.</div>
<div class="class14">Refusing to respond with anger is a <span class="class11">simple</span>
 exercise, but not <span class="class11">easy</span>
. And that’s why, combined with the fact that most of us deal with aggressive people at least once a week, it can be a valuable <span id="calibre_link-1531"></span>
opportunity for you to increase your self-control when interacting with others.</div>
<div class="class14">As a bonus quote for today, ponder the words of Hazrat Inayat Khan:</div>
<div class="class14">“Very often in everyday life one sees that by losing one’s temper with someone who has already lost his, one does not gain anything but only sets out upon the path of stupidity. He who has enough self-control to stand firm at the moment when the other person is in a temper, wins in the end. It is not he who has spoken a hundred words aloud who has won; it is he who has perhaps spoken only one word.”<span id="calibre_link-891"></span>

<div class="class14">If you have a few unpleasant tasks to perform and you have no idea where to start, begin with the least unpleasant task to ease yourself into the pain, so to speak. Once you cross off the first task, working on the next task &mdash; even if it’s more painful than the first one &mdash; should be easier because you’ll be warmed up, carried forward by the positive momentum.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s like taking a brief, 10-second cold shower prior to jumping into a cold swimming pool (something I used to do when I was a regular at my local swimming pool). You’ve already exhibited some self-control, warmed yourself up for discomfort (I know, “warming yourself up” isn’t really a good choice of words here) and now the more unpleasant act of submerging your body in cold water should be easier. After all, you’ve already taken the first step and gained some momentum.</div>
<div class="class14">If even the least unpleasant task on your list is still so overwhelming that you don’t want to get to it, warm yourself up to discomfort by doing virtually anything else that’s slightly uncomfortable, such as doing the dishes, performing a quick set of squats, or cleaning your desk<span id="calibre_link-1533"></span>

<div class="class14">While people usually associate self-discipline with the ability to resist temptations (such as laziness or overeating), another equally (if not more) important benefit of self-control is the increased ability to control your emotions.</div>
<div class="class14">Both negative and positive feelings make our lives more exciting, but they can also jeopardize our long-term goals if we let them influence our behavior too much.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re impatient and tend to rush things, one wrong, emotionally-motivated decision can destroy the progress of many months or years.</div>
<div class="class14">A more disciplined approach to impatience &mdash; recognizing the difference between when the emotion can actually inspire positive change and when it’s a sign of dissatisfaction with something you can’t control &mdash; would serve you more than letting impatience dictate all of your behaviors.</div>
<div class="class14">Positive emotions, as pleasant as they feel, can also affect you negatively. For example, being overjoyed with your results carries the danger of self-congratulation and subsequent complacency, which places you at risk of losing the habits that you had to develop to reach that success<span id="calibre_link-1537"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">A more disciplined approach to joy &mdash; expressing your happiness and gratitude for your success, and then reminding yourself that you still have a lot to learn and promptly looking for another challenge &mdash; would serve you more than jumping from joy and assuming that now that you’ve accomplished your goal, you’re a world-class expert and now nothing will ever stand in your way.</div>

<div class="class14">I’m a big proponent of daily routines, not only because they ensure that you steadily advance toward your goal, but also because they reduce the likelihood of negative moods ruining your progress.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s not fool ourselves &mdash; we’re humans, and sometimes we feel bad. If you don’t have a daily routine and wake up in a bad mood, it’s almost certain that you won’t care much about your current resolutions and forego them for the rest of the day. Handling your negative mood will be more important than any other objectives you might have had.</div>
<div class="class14">However, if you’ve established a daily routine and it’s now instilled in your mind, the risk that you won’t perform it is much lower. Why is that so? Because the beautiful thing about a daily routine is that once it’s automatic, you feel bad when you don’t do it. This means that if you’re in a bad mood, not performing your routine will make you feel even worse, so the best choice is to stick to your routine in spite of your bad mood.</div>
<div class="class14">When setting important long-term goals, also create daily routines that will steadily move you toward achieving them. Once established, they will be some of your biggest allies.</div>

<div class="class14">Many top performers follow specific routines, but they all differ wildly. For example, Pablo Picasso worked between 3 p.m. and 2 a.m., with a one-hour break at 10 p.m., while Victor Hugo spent most of his day on leisure, except for a 2-hour writing session between 6 and 8 p.m. Benjamin Franklin woke up at 5 in the morning, while Pablo Picasso didn’t wake up until 11 a.m.</div>

<div class="class14">At a minimum, develop at least three routines in your life that will eliminate indecision and improve your control of the day:</div>
<div class="class14">
<span class="class28">1. When you wake up and when you go to bed.</span>
 Life is unpredictable and things will happen, but you can choose your working hours and ensure a highly predictable weekly schedule.</div>

<div class="class14">An often-overlooked benefit of self-discipline is that it’s a rare trait. Consequently, it makes you a more valuable employee when compared to your lazy colleagues, a more respected boss when compared to a boss who demands a lot from others but not from themselves, or a more trustworthy business partner when compared to a person who doesn’t mind cutting corners.</div>
<div class="class14">Since self-discipline is so hard to attain, there will always be more demand than supply. This can indirectly lead to more opportunities and a better financial situation.</div>
<div class="class14">If you still find it hard to resist temptations, emotions often get the best of you, and you can’t overcome the allure of instant gratification, try to give self-discipline a monetary value.</div>
<div class="class14">The fact that you’re becoming more productive (thanks to more self-discipline) increases your chances of being promoted at work. More self-discipline means that you’ll improve more quickly at a skill that you plan to monetize soon. And if you’re an entrepreneur, it directly affects how much income you generate.</div>
<div class="class14">It probably sounds ridiculous to suggest that you can become a more self-disciplined person by linking self-discipline with higher income, but can you deny that money is a powerful motivator for many people<span id="calibre_link-1545"></span>

<div class="class14">If I were to give you $100,000 if you eliminated three bad habits from your life, I’m pretty sure that no matter how many times you had failed to get rid of them before, this time you’d succeed.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of self-discipline in the same category as any other skill or credential you could list on your resume or in a sales brochure. It doesn’t cost anything (other than your time and energy) to develop this ability, and the return on this investment can be higher than any other lucrative endeavor you might pursue.</div>

s</div>
<div class="class20">Stress &mdash; including negative emotions like anger, sadness, self-doubt, and anxiety &mdash; shifts the brain into a reward-seeking state. You end up craving whatever substance or activity your brain associates with the promise of reward, and you become convinced that the “reward” is the only way to feel better.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Kelly McGonigal</span>
<span id="calibre_link-727"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-726" class="class23">167</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">There are two types of stress: <span class="class11">distress</span>
, which is negative stress in the common usage of this word, and <span class="class11">eustress</span>
, the good type of stress in which you respond to stress with healthy, positive feelings (for example, during an athletic competition or riding a roller coaster).</div>
<div class="class14">Distress, and particularly chronic distress, is one of the biggest enemies of willpower. When you’re under stress, your ability to withstand pressure diminishes. This means that you can no longer exhibit the same kind of mental toughness and self-discipline as when you’re your normal self. It’s like expecting your car (you) to have the same acceleration when there’s a semi-truck (stress) attached to it.</div>
<div class="class14">As Kelly McGonigal notes, stress puts you into a reward-seeking state where your priority ceases to be about personal growth (such as overcoming a temptation), and becomes all about gaining comfort, often at the expense of your long-term goals. And it makes a lot of sense: why would a person who’s stressed out seek more stressors?</div>
<div class="class14">Chronically elevated levels of stress will not only have a negative effect on your health and well-being, but also on your entire life. If you often get stressed, make it your priority to relax daily, <span id="calibre_link-1548"></span>
even if it’s just five minutes of cuddling with your partner, reading a book, or taking a short walk.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to that, avoid setting any new challenges for your willpower and conserve your energy when you’re going through a tough period. It’s better to deal with the stress first and then (having recovered) focus on personal growth yet again, than it is to put too much burden on your shoulders and collapse under the weight.</div>

<div class="class14">If you define yourself by only one role &mdash; an entrepreneur, a surfer, a writer, or a pianist &mdash; your self-image might be heavily dependent on your performance in this role. This can make you incapable of effectively processing big failures in that area.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, it’s good to define yourself by at least several roles. Then, even when you fail in one domain, there will still be other areas in which your performance might still inspire hope and help you recover from the failure in that other thing.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if I have a bad day when rock climbing, it won’t affect my well-being very much if I’m still doing well as a writer or have recently improved my language skills or strengthened a key relationship. If I considered myself exclusively a rock climber, each failure would crush me.</div>
<div class="class14">How many roles do you have? How many of them affect your self-image? If you have only one or two defining roles, consider adding an additional identity or two. That way, you’ll disperse any <span id="calibre_link-1551"></span>
negative emotions over several domains and improve your ability to quickly bounce back from any failure in one of them.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s a super simple way to improve your self-control when eating: eat alone. When people eat with others, they eat more &mdash; and the greater the number of people who share the meal with you, the more you eat.</div>
<div class="class14">However, studies suggest that this phenomenon isn’t related to the amount of time spent eating.<span id="calibre_link-839"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-838" class="class25">170</a>
 It’s the companionship in itself that makes humans more likely to eat more when they are around other people than when alone. The same happens with animals. With chickens, for example, a full chicken will continue eating if a hungry chicken starts eating with it.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently on a diet and you frequently have a bite with other people, ask yourself how important it is for you to spend time eating with them. Perhaps you could forego or reduce the number of shared meals while you’re on a diet and find a different activity that you could do together.</div>
<div class="class14">Sometimes such simple tweaks can quickly produce big results, so give it a go for at least a few weeks and see whether it can help you achieve your goals more quickly.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1554" class="class9">Day 174: On Experiencing Life</div>
<div class="class20">Accept what life offers you and try to drink from every cup. All wines should be tasted; some should only be sipped, but with others, drink the whole bottle.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-871"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-870" class="class23">171</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">While this book and most of my other books glorify self-discipline and make it sound like the most important thing in the world, I don’t want you to think that a life of deprivation is the right one. In fact, I believe that unless you espouse self-discipline in a healthy way, it might be close to impossible to maintain it in the long haul.</div>
<div class="class14">However, what <span class="class11">is</span>
 a healthy approach to self-discipline? It’s the attitude that self-discipline exists to support you in your goals, but it shouldn’t prevent you from fully experiencing life.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I’m now on an overseas trip. While I’m still largely following my routine by waking up early and working in the morning, I also make exceptions: I work less, my diet is not as strict, and I allow myself to be lazier. I’m still working toward some goals, but I put some on a temporary hold. I can always work on them later, while pushing myself now would mean that I wouldn’t be able to experience the trip to the fullest and recharge my batteries.</div>
<div class="class14">I want you to be as self-disciplined as possible, but I don’t want you to skip eating spaghetti, pizza, or ice cream while in Italy, avoid eating a piece of birthday cake at your best friend’s party, or to not enjoy sunny weather and goof off at the beach every now and then<span id="calibre_link-1555"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">However, as the quote from Paulo Coelho’s says, please note that you should experience some things only a little, while others are there to be enjoyed to the fullest. There are also experiences that you can skip without any regrets. For example, you don’t have to take hard drugs to know that it’s a bad idea, while indulging in unhealthy food <span class="class11">every now and then</span>
 (ideally when celebrating something with your loved ones) isn’t that bad.</div>
<div class="class14">Lastly, don’t treat it as a permission to cheat. You shouldn’t go on a trip while in the middle of your diet just so you can indulge in unhealthy food or get lazy because it’s sunny outside while you have an urgent job to do.</div>
<div class="class14">Accept with welcoming hands what life has to offer, but make sure that you drink from the right cups, and in the right amount &mdash; not too little, and not too much.</div>

<div class="class20">Using the mouse, stirring your coffee, opening doors. This requires people to practice self-control because their habitual tendency is to use their dominant hands.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-907"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-906" class="class23">172</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">One interesting exercise to improve your self-control is to start using your other hand for the things you usually do with your dominant one. For example, use your non-dominant hand for brushing your teeth, pouring drinks into a cup, washing yourself, doing the dishes, opening jars, stirring coffee, or opening doors.</div>
<div class="class14">Psychologist Thomas Denson had people use their non-dominant hand for two weeks for any task that was safe to do that way. After two weeks, people in the group using the non-dominant hand controlled their aggression better.</div>
<div class="class14">What does it have to do with self-control? It’s because aggression, or virtually any other thing you control by exerting self-discipline, is an impulse. Just like you automatically open doors with your dominant hand, so do you impulsively reply with anger, grab a cookie, or choose the elevator instead of the stairs.</div>
<div class="class14">Conscious change in your automatic behaviors, such as intentionally using your non-dominant hand, can then help you improve your ability to control impulses, and by extension, make <span id="calibre_link-1557"></span>
you more self-disciplined. I know, it’s a wild theory, but why not try it? Even if it only produces small improvements, it’s still a fun experiment.</div>

<div class="class20">The palest ink is more reliable than the most powerful memory.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Chinese proverb</div>
<div class="class14">It’s all fine and dandy to tell yourself that you’re going to achieve this and that goal. However, in the end, our memories are fickle. You can forget about some goals, or stop working on them simply because they were never <span class="class11">real</span>
 in the first place &mdash; you’ve never written them down, so they only existed in your head and if something is only in your head, you can conveniently make it disappear without a trace or simply forget it without intending to.</div>
<div class="class14">Develop a habit of writing down your goals, even if it’s only one sentence or two. Thanks to the habit of tracking your goals on paper, you’ll look at your objectives as real-world resolutions and not just mere ideas floating through your head that you can disregard whenever you feel like doing so. It’s more difficult to do the same if your goals are written, because erasing them &mdash; regardless if it’s by deleting a text file or tearing up a piece of paper &mdash; will make it painfully clear that you’re giving up on them.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to writing down your goals, write down specific routines that you plan to follow in order to achieve them. For example, for this book, I have a spreadsheet in which I note down how many daily entries I write each day. That way, I can hold myself accountable and compare my performance today to that of <span id="calibre_link-1559"></span>
the past. Moreover, it makes it clear to me how close I am to achieving my goal, and all of that boosts my motivation to keep going. It also lets me see if things are going as planned and if the plan itself needs revision in order to improve the results.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-943"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-942" class="class23">173</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Sleep is one of the needs that you can’t control no matter how self-disciplined you are. You can choose to go without food for a few days and you’ll be fine. If you’ve been going without sleep for, say, 48 hours, even in a situation like driving (when falling asleep means certain death), you still won’t be able to control it.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, sleep is king and you should do all in your power to ensure that you have a good night’s sleep. Studies show that a lack of or poor sleep can negatively affect self-control. I don’t think I need to cite research to convince you that it’s true. You probably have plenty of empiric evidence from your own life, and so do I.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re half-asleep the entire day, your only priority will be to go to sleep as quickly as possible. Who cares about dieting, exercise, money, etc. if they can barely think straight, their mental capacity reduced to zero.</div>
<div class="class14">There are several key things you can do to improve your sleep:</div>
<div class="class14">1. Make sure you have a comfortable mattress. Most mattresses should be replaced at least every ten years<span id="calibre_link-1561"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">2. Make sure you sleep in silence. Any noise will dramatically reduce the sleep quality. Use earplugs if there’s no way to soundproof your bedroom.</div>
<div class="class14">3. Make sure you sleep in the right temperature. The most beneficial temperature for sleep is 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit (15-19 Celsius).<span id="calibre_link-976"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-975" class="class25">174</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">4. Make sure you reduce the amount of blue light you receive in the evening, especially during the last hour before you want to be asleep. This means not using electronics before sleep, and if not possible (as is the case for most of us), put on blue-blocking goggles and make sure to expose yourself to bright light during the day.</div>
<div class="class14">5. Make sure your racing mind is asleep. If you have any lingering thoughts, write them down and resume thinking about them the next day. You won’t have to revisit them during the time you should be sleeping because you will have written them down.</div>
<div class="class14">6. Make sure you don’t consume caffeine when it’s less than six hours prior to sleep (it takes three to seven hours for caffeine to metabolize<span id="calibre_link-1009"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1008" class="class25">175</a>
). Caffeine-induced sleep disorder is a real thing, and even if you can fall asleep after drinking tea of coffee, it doesn’t mean your sleep is of high quality.</div>
<div class="class14">7. Make sure you don’t consume a big meal prior to going to sleep. Give your body at least two hours after eating before you go to sleep.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-1038" class="class23">176</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Momentum will carry you forward almost automatically for as long as you stick to your resolutions every day. Missing one day every now and then isn’t that dangerous, but if it’s two or more days without any action taken to get you closer to your goal, the risk of giving up on your goal dramatically increases.</div>
<div class="class14">What I’ve found from my personal experience is that you don’t necessarily have to always stick to your resolutions exactly as they are stated. If, for example, you have a goal to write 1,000 words a day and for a weekend you can only write 100 words each day, you should still be able to resume your regular routine on Monday easily. If, however, you skip writing altogether, resuming your routine will be much more challenging.</div>
<div class="class14">The same happens with exercise, where even a super brief 5-minute workout will still be better than not exercising at all, or when changing your nutritional habits, where adding even one tiny vegetable to your plate is better than only eating junk food.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you find yourself in a situation where it’s hard to stick to your goals, take one full day off if you need it, but on the next day perform at least one tiny action associated with your goal. That way you’ll still maintain some momentum and ensure that it will be easier to resume your regular routine when you’re ready.</div>

<div class="class14">Today I’d like to approach this subject from another perspective &mdash; that effort leads to long-term satisfaction. By choosing what now feels like a choice that maximizes your happiness (delegating the work), not only do you miss potential opportunities to learn, but you also lose the positive feelings you can get from expending the effort yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">As I’ve already stated , it’s not possible for most people to do everything themselves. However, whenever you can afford to do so, overcome your laziness and inertia, exert some willpower and, <span id="calibre_link-1564"></span>
instead of having somebody else do something for you, do it yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">Yes, in the beginning it probably won’t feel as nice as the relaxation you could get from somebody else handling it for you, but in the end the expended effort will probably make you happier; this will also improve your ability to discipline yourself instead of defaulting to delegating the work to others.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Small irritating things tend to grow into bigger problems the longer you let them continue. Moreover, the longer the situation continues, the more difficult it is to resolve it.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, it’s important to develop a habit of paying the price as fast as possible: engage in something a little unpleasant today to resolve the situation before it gets worse and more difficult to handle.</div>
<div class="class14">To share an example with you, there was a time when I used to carry a large textile bag and a duffel bag for each outdoors climbing session. I was too lazy to take my climbing gear out of my gym bag and put it into a travel backpack that was more suitable for transportation between one crag and another.</div>
<div class="class14">I used to complain about it, but I didn’t do anything about the situation because it was only a small irritant. Usually it didn’t take more than a couple of minutes to access the crag, so it wasn’t a big deal to carry the gear this way<span id="calibre_link-1566"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Then one sector required a twenty-minute walk on a hiking path with steep declines and inclines. I quickly discovered how stupid and uncomfortable it was to carry climbing gear in something other than a backpack.</div>
<div class="class14">On the next occasion, I overcame my laziness and put my climbing gear into a backpack. It took me just a few minutes to repack my things, and now I could comfortably walk from one crag to another. Paying the price as fast as possible &mdash; the first time I realized there was a problem &mdash; would have helped me avoid unnecessary discomfort.</div>
<div class="class14">This and other similar lessons have taught me that it’s best to act as soon as you realize that there’s a problem or an unpleasant thing to do. Use your self-control to handle any irritants, no matter how small they might be, right away. You’ll not only get rid of the problem, you’ll also exercise your willpower muscle each time you decide to act immediately instead of postponing it.</div>

<div class="class14">It takes work to simplify one’s life, and perhaps that’s why most people are engaged in the undisciplined pursuit of more rather than less.</div>
<div class="class14">Saying no is uncomfortable, so by default they say yes to new obligations. They don’t pause and ponder on how they use up their energy because it takes too much work. There’s always something urgent to do, and hence they never take the time to deliberately eliminate what’s unessential in their lives so they can focus on what matters.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s particularly important to remedy a situation in which your non-priorities dominate your priorities. For example, when you spend several hours a week cleaning your house and then don’t have time and energy for exercise, it’s a clear case of nonessentials robbing your priorities. Harness the power of self-discipline to make some uncomfortable changes, such as hiring a cleaning person so that you can free up your time and energy to focus on what matters more &mdash; your well-being<span id="calibre_link-1568"></span>

<div class="class14">If you want to retain control over your life, embrace the strategy of deliberately pursuing less.

In addition to that, in the case of saying yes, you risk feeling resentful toward the person who asked you to do something you didn’t want to do.</div>
<div class="class14">Practice your self-control by saying no when you’re tempted to say yes just to avoid awkwardness.

In addition to making the world a better place, it will serve as a powerful exercise in self-control and transform your mindset to that of a producer, a person who will always be valued in society, regardless of the economy or location<span id="calibre_link-1574"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, whenever you ask somebody for advice, share the knowledge with two or more other people. At work, try to do your best &mdash; and if your job doesn’t excite you enough to do so, do everybody a favor and find a different job that will let you contribute to the world in a better way. Support other creators instead of criticizing them. Don’t always wait for somebody else to take the initiative: step forward and organize something yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">Resist the temptation to consume without ever contributing much yourself. The more value you create, the better off everyone is &mdash; and the more that eventually comes back to you.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1575" class="class9">Day 185: On Staying With Problems Longer</div>
<div class="class20">Students who were forced to struggle on complex problems before receiving help from teachers outperformed students who received immediate assistance.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness</span>
<span id="calibre_link-128"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-127" class="class23">183</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s a simple mindset change that can help you improve your problem-solving skills and make you more persistent: whenever you face a problem, stay with it for a good while before you ask anyone for help.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re immediately seeking outside help the instant you find you can’t deal with something, you’re robbing yourself out of the opportunity to struggle and figure it out yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, this doesn’t apply to life-or-death situations. I don’t want you to spend a little while longer trying to figure out how to help a victim of a car accident &mdash; call the ambulance right away. Practice staying with problems longer only when it’s safe and sensible to do so.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if something is not working properly on your computer, before you call for IT help, seek answers yourself and only get help if you’ve tried several possible solutions and nothing has worked<span id="calibre_link-1576"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re learning a new skill and can’t figure out how to do something, try to deconstruct it, piece by piece. If you still can’t figure it out, seek assistance from your teacher.</div>
<div class="class14">By rejecting the impulse to ask for help right away, you’ll also practice your self-control. The downside is wasting a few minutes on a problem you can’t solve. The upside is developing more trust in your own abilities, becoming more patient, and learning something new.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1577" class="class9">Day 186: On Simple Rules</div>
<div class="class20">Simple rules are shortcut strategies that save time and effort by focusing our attention and simplifying the way we process information. The rules aren’t universal &mdash; they’re tailored to the particular situation and the person using them.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Donald Sull</span>
<span id="calibre_link-188"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-187" class="class23">184</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">I’m a big fan of using rules to simplify my life. In today’s world, we have too many choices to make. Many of those choices are trivial, but because we don’t want to miss out, we waste precious time deciding where we want to go for dinner, whether we want to drink blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, or blackberry juice, and then waste even more time choosing a meal we want to eat.</div>
<div class="class14">And that’s just one common situation in a sea of choices. Which brand of bread to eat? Which fitness regimen to follow? Where to go for a vacation? Which book to read? The choices are endless, and they’re all sucking energy that you could spend on something more constructive and useful.</div>
<div class="class14">Embrace some simple rules in your life to pare down your choices to the bare minimum.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I have a simple rule when it comes to traveling: I never travel to cold places. If it’s less than 60-70 degrees Fahrenheit (15&ndash;20 degrees Celsius) there, I’m not going. This greatly limits my choices, I know that the weather will be relatively good, and I get to spend more time planning the actual trip rather than choosing the destination<span id="calibre_link-1578"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Another example, more from the realm of personal development, is my rule of never giving up on anything that’s important to me. Having established that something is important to me, I don’t give up. I can’t break my rule, so I’ll stick to a goal for as long as necessary or until it stops being important to me.</div>
<div class="class14">My other rules include things like not taking group classes (I find it to be an extremely ineffective way of learning when the attention of the teacher is spread out over several students or more), rejecting interviews and social media (I’d rather spend my time by writing a new book), and always choosing solutions that minimize my <span class="class11">time</span>
 investment, even if they’re financially more expensive (such as choosing more expensive airport parking to be closer to the terminal or buying more expensive products to reduce the risk of them breaking down).</div>
<div class="class14">What are your rules? Think of some common decisions you often have to make &mdash; including the important choices related to your goals &mdash; and think of simple rules you could establish to simplify your life and your decision-making process.</div>
</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1579" class="class9">Day 187: On Not Judging Too Quickly</div>
<div class="class20">Realize that other people think their behavior is more responsive to situational factors than you’re inclined to think &mdash; and they’re more likely to be right than you are. They almost certainly know their current situation &mdash; and their relevant personal history &mdash; better than you do.</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;Richard Nisbett</span>
<span id="calibre_link-248"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-247" class="class23">185</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">You can develop your self-control while working on your most important goals, but you can also practice it in everyday situations &mdash;when judging people, for example.</div>
<div class="class14">Virtually all of us have done it at least once: you assume you know what’s best for another person, while in fact you know nothing about their background or approach to the current situation, yet you judge. It’s hard to resist this temptation; after all, we look at the world through our own filters and consider them suitable for everything and everyone.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you catch yourself judging someone harshly, pause and ask yourself if you understand this person’s personal history, motives, and current situation.</div>
<div class="class14">A driver who honked at you might have been a jerk, but he might also have just been diagnosed with cancer, late to an important meeting or driving to the hospital to visit a relative<span id="calibre_link-1580"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">An overweight person might be lazy, but he or she might also struggle with difficult family issues, health disorders, or be battling against depression.</div>
<div class="class14">You never know the entire picture, so the best approach is to refrain from judging. You’ll improve your “people skills” and at the same time you’ll be practicing your self-control.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1581" class="class9">Day 188: On Prid<span id="calibre_link-1582" class="calibre2"></span>
e</div>
<div class="class20">All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Sophocles</span>
<span id="calibre_link-640"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-639" class="class23">186</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Pride has a positive connotation. You’re proud of your achievements, proud of your children, or proud of your country.</div>
<div class="class14">However, pride often serves as an excuse to stick to the wrong path or deny responsibility for your wrongdoings. It’s also dangerous when it converts to egotism, a state leading to complacency and overestimating your abilities.</div>
<div class="class14">Embrace a healthy approach toward accomplishment: appreciate your successes, but don’t put pride on the pedestal and discontinue further efforts just because somebody acknowledged your triumphs.</div>
<div class="class14">I sometimes receive emails from my readers telling me that my books have changed their lives. I’m happy to hear that they’ve found my work valuable, but &mdash; as strange as it may sound &mdash; I refuse to feel proud of my books. My books might have been the spark, but it’s the reader’s efforts that have helped them change their lives. If I were to convince myself that my books are so incredible, I would have probably become complacent or let the success go to my head.</div>
<div class="class14">Another aspect of pride is stubbornly following the wrong path. A common demonstration of this behavior is particularly common among men: when they get lost, they’ll put off asking somebody for directions for as long as they can, while they continue their journey in the wrong direction<span id="calibre_link-1583"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of acknowledging the mistake, swallowing their pride, and asking for help, they waste time and energy just because they’re too prideful.</div>
<div class="class14">If you recognize such a behavior in yourself, vow to never again let pride make you overinvest in the wrong endeavors. The moment you realize you’re following the wrong path, stop. Go back to the drawing board, prepare new plans and start again. In the grand scheme of things, your pride is of small importance when compared to achieving your large long-term goals.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-465" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1584" class="class9">Day 189: On Adventures</div>
<div class="class20">So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Jon Krakauer</span>
<span id="calibre_link-675"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-674" class="class23">187</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Boredom is dangerous not only because it’s unpleasant, but also because it usually means having the worst kind of security in life &mdash; complacency. It’s good to feel satisfied with what you have, but the moment you get stuck in a rut, afraid that any change will ruin the security you now enjoy, you lose the opportunity for immense joy and personal growth.</div>
<div class="class14">Adventures spice up life. Without new experiences, life is boring and there’s little growth to be attained. When you’re bored, you’re less likely to feel inspired to make changes in life, so it leads to a downward spiral.</div>
<div class="class14">Embark on new adventures as often as you can. Traveling always means encounters with new experiences, but you don’t necessarily have to leave your hometown every week to live an adventurous life. Learning new interesting skills can be an adventure <span id="calibre_link-1585"></span>
in itself. Hiking to a nearby wilderness area or spending the night in a tent outdoors can get you out of a rut, too.</div>
<div class="class14">Lastly, to actually be considered adventures, they are usually at least slightly uncomfortable or dangerous, and that also means an opportunity to practice self-discipline and toughen up. Plan your next adventure now!</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-717" class="class23">188</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">When setting a new resolution, be specific about it, and particularly about the way a certain behavior you want to give up makes you feel.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, saying “I’m not going to eat pizza anymore” isn’t going to be as visceral as saying “I’m not going to eat that thing that makes me bloated, obese, and tired anymore.” The former is a weak, non-emotional statement; the latter is a strong resolution that reminds you about the reason why you want to stop engaging in a given activity.</div>
<div class="class14">This strategy works the other way, too. Instead of saying “I’m going to write 1000 words a day,” say “I’m going to write 1000 words a day, the activity that makes me feel so energized, creative, and hopeful about the future in which I’m a bestselling author.”</div>
<div class="class14">A more specific, emotionally-charged resolution will stick in your mind better, and that will help you keep going or pause and think before breaking a resolution.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1587" class="class9">Day 191: On Futile Determination</div>
<div class="class20">If any man is able to convince me and show me that I do not think or act right, I will gladly change; for I seek the truth by which no man was ever injured. But he is injured who abides in his error and ignorance.</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;Marcus Aurelius</span>
<span id="calibre_link-759"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-758" class="class23">189</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Determination can change your life, but it can also lead to a lot of wasted time if you stubbornly keep going when everyone around you who’s knowledgeable about the goal you want to reach tells you that you’re following the wrong path.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, if the only people who are trying to convince you that you’re wrong have no idea about what you’re doing, you can safely ignore their advice. If, however, people who have reached the goals you’re striving to achieve are trying to correct your ways, heed their advice.</div>
<div class="class14">I sometimes offer advice to new entrepreneurs who have big dreams, but the word “realistic” doesn’t seem to be a part of their dictionary. I tell them to listen to the experts, get their feet wet with a simple business model and slowly build real-world experience. Unfortunately, many of them ignore this advice only to return months or years later, this time with more humility and a desire to apply their immense desire and determination in a way that it can actually lead to results.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t get me wrong &mdash; I’m all for bold undertakings, but often what those entrepreneurs do is waste time and energy, investing their vast reserves of determination into a project that was doomed to fail <span id="calibre_link-1588"></span>
from the get-go because they had no real-world business experience to make it succeed.</div>
<div class="class14">I know how it works, because I was such a person, too.</div>
<div class="class14">The first time I read <span class="class11">The Millionaire Fastlane</span>
 by MJ DeMarco (a book that eventually changed my life), I didn’t heed the author’s advice about not pursuing money-making schemes. I thought I knew better, and foolishly stuck to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and affiliate marketing. I had to suffer from several more failures before I was ready to listen to people who were more experienced than I was.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to save yourself from unnecessary failures, be open to feedback from people who have achieved the goals you’d like to reach. Don’t abide in error and ignorance, digging for gold like a mad man where hundreds of people had dug before you and didn’t find anything.</div>

With the same amount of practice, the long-term-commitment group outperformed the short-term-commitment group by 400 percent.

<div class="class14">There’s something about long-term commitment that makes it immensely more powerful than doing something once-off, even when the amount of time spent practicing is the same in both cases.</div>
<div class="class14">What matters is not putting in the same number of hours every now and then, but putting in time consistently, even if it’s a small amount of time. In other words, the winning strategy is that of a marathoner, running long distances slowly, and not that of a sprinter, running short distances quickly.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, as a writer, I currently follow a routine of writing at least 1000 words a day. I wouldn’t be able to do my best work by not having a schedule and writing in a random fashion instead. It’s the everyday habit that keeps my writing sharp, and whenever I take a longer break from writing, I need at least several days to get back into the groove. Consequently, I make sure that even if I can’t write 1000 words for some reason, I at least write <span class="class11">something</span>

<div class="class14">Are your goals designed in such a way that you’re working on them regularly or are you doing them from time to time, in an erratic fashion? How can you develop a system that will ensure that each day or each week you practice for a set period of time?</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Changing yourself doesn’t necessarily mean throwing away your old life, cutting ties with your family and friends and moving to another corner of the world. If, however, certain aspects of your old life clearly hold you back, it <span class="class11">is</span>
 necessary to replace them with something new to enable your identity to change.</div>
<div class="class14">If, for example, your primary way of spending time is going to nightclubs and partying, don’t expect to become highly productive until you get rid of that habit and embrace a new, less exciting, lifestyle. Some of your friends will probably resent you for it, but if they’re against you doing what you need to do for your personal growth, are they truly your friends?</div>
<div class="class14">Likewise, pursuing important long-term goals often means becoming a part of a new community, visiting places you’ve never been to before, and embracing habits that you’ve never thought about. It’s understandable to feel some resistance toward destroying your old ways and replacing them with something new, but ultimately it’s how you become a new person<span id="calibre_link-1593"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I was apprehensive about terminating my bodybuilding workout regimen and switching to an entirely different, bodyweight-based approach to exercise. I had to follow new experts, perform new exercises, and train in a different environment.</div>
<div class="class14">There’s no way around it; if you want something new in your life, something old has to go, no matter how sentimental you are about it or how scared you are that the new thing might not work well for you.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Pain, particularly during strenuous exercise, is often so overpowering that you can barely think straight. However, it’s through this pain that we grow, and it’s a necessary part of the process, just like embracing discomfort in general is essential for rejecting instant gratification in order to accomplish your long-term goals.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you feel tempted to give up because of momentary pain, do your best to remind yourself that pain passes, but the disappointment you’ll feel upon quitting will accompany you for a long time. Giving up will give you some relief right now, but the price you’ll have to pay will be ultimately more painful than bearing the pain a little while longer.</div>
<div class="class14">If you think that there’s no way you can handle the pain &mdash; something that will probably happen to you during the first several weeks of exercising, for example &mdash; tell yourself to only bear it for three seconds longer and then give up. Often, pain is a fleeting high-intensity burst at the moment you first feel it, and then it quickly recedes as your body adapts to it &mdash; something I experienced in numerous workouts, as well as when I took cold showers. Waiting for three seconds before you give up can be enough time to enable you to withstand the pain and keep going<span id="calibre_link-1596"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">As a quick disclaimer, please don’t mistake the kind of pain that’s safe, signaling you’re pushing yourself, with the kind of pain that’s the signal of an injury. Whenever you are pushing your limits, always prioritize safety over everything else.</div>

<div class="class14">In essence, when you’re putting something off, it’s because you don’t care about it enough to take action now. If there’s no natural drive to get it done, then it means you’re forcing yourself into doing something that isn’t right for you.</div>
<div class="class14">Perhaps it’s the wrong action or you’re thinking about it in the wrong way. Regardless, in both of those circumstances, procrastination tells you that you’re lacking the right motivation.</div>
<div class="class14">If you woke up in the early morning in a burning house, would you put off getting up for later?</div>
<div class="class14">Likewise, if you cared deep down about building a business, would you procrastinate about doing the necessary work?

<div class="class14">We’ve already talked about living in accordance with your principles and using simple rules to improve your decision-making process.</div>
<div class="class14">Today I’d like to talk about a related topic: the importance of life maxims.</div>
<div class="class14">I’ve already told you that metaphors can help instill a change better than any amount of specific step-by-step instructions &mdash; and so can the maxims you live by.</div>
<div class="class14">Ponder the common statement that life is hard. If you truly believe that life is hard, then how does it affect your character? Are you going to be a cheery, optimistic person or adapt a defeatist outlook on life?</div>
<div class="class14">How about thinking that a stranger is a friend you haven’t met? Will this make you more likely to be a friendly person and develop a supportive circle of friends or close you off to new opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals?</div>
<div class="class14">What about adopting the maxim that everything in life is possible as long as you refuse to listen to reason? Okay, you won’t become the President of the United States if you weren’t born in that country (and a few other things), but other than that, would you say that living by such a maxim will hinder your growth or perhaps empower you<span id="calibre_link-1604"></span>
?</div>
<div class="class14">Your maxims expose your character. If you want to be successful, make sure that your maxims are empowering and positive. Make a list of the most important truths you live by &mdash; consciously or unconsciously &mdash; and ask yourself if they all serve you to become a better person. If they don’t, discard them and replace them with different, more advantageous ones.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">If you can’t shake yourself out of inaction for your own benefit, perhaps you can do it by having others in mind. This type of motivation is called <span class="class11">prosocial motivation</span>
; it means taking action for the benefit of somebody or something beyond yourself: your family, your favorite charity, your community, the environment, etc.</div>
<div class="class14">Spend some time thinking how your inaction hurts the people around you. For some people, the negative motivation they can get from such an exercise is more powerful than any words of encouragement. The guilt they feel upon realizing they’re betraying their family or harming the planet can be a more enticing motivator than getting the rewards for themselves, whether they’re internal or external ones.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s a technique I sometimes use to motivate myself to write. I’ve developed the skill of writing and people seem to enjoy and benefit from my books. If I don’t write more books, I’m hurting them by depriving them of the education and possibly valuable insights that they could get by reading my works<span id="calibre_link-1606"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re the type of a person who often cares more about others than yourself, this sort of motivation can turn you into a high achiever, However, be cautious not to overdo it: the point isn’t to spend your life working yourself into the ground, forever feeling guilty that you could do even more. Strive to produce value for everyone, including yourself.</div>

<div class="class14">What’s the point?</div>
<div class="class14">Like Admiral King says, if a ship has been sunk, it’s not like you can bring it up and set sail again. If you made a mistake, it’s not like you can undo it. You can fix some of its consequences, but you can’t turn back the clock. Likewise, you can’t change the decision you made a week ago; all you can do is make a different decision today. Nor can you foresee the future; all you can do is try to do your best and prepare for the worst.</div>
<div class="class14">Tap into your resources of willpower whenever you catch yourself fretting about yesterday’s problems. Instead of ruminating about them, think about what you can do today &mdash; right here and right now &mdash; to improve your life. Ultimately, the only control you <span id="calibre_link-1608"></span>

<div class="class14">Guess why I write books about self-discipline! Just kidding, though writing has definitely helped me clarify my ideas and better understand them myself.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you find yourself in a conversation with somebody who is wondering how to instill more self-discipline in their lives, don’t hesitate to share your experiences or even serve as their unofficial coach and mentor.</div>
<div class="class14">Another wonderful way to teach others is to participate in online forums or on social media sites. Teach others how you succeeded with your goals or how you successfully overcame a recent temptation, and you’ll not only help them achieve <span class="class11">their</span>

<div class="class14">This technique sounds simplistic, but it’s actually a powerful way to escape from fear-driven paralysis.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re constantly worried that your business will not succeed and you’re procrastinating about getting started, assume that it <span class="class11">will</span>

e</div>
<div class="class20">Those who have accomplished the greatest results are those who never lose self-control, but are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Ryan Holiday</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1141"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-119" class="class23">201</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Being calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite are all traits that everyone interested in building self-discipline should aspire to have. Let’s go through them one by one and offer some pointers on how to develop them.</div>
<div class="class14">Staying calm means being free of nervousness, anger, and other negative emotions that can take away your self-control and make you do things you’ll later regret. In essence, staying calm comes down to mindfulness and the clear logical thinking that comes from that.</div>
<div class="class14">One of the best ways to become calmer is to engage in some type of a meditative practice. Whether it’s traditional meditation, engaging in a high-focus sport, or doing something that captures your full attention, it will serve as an exercise in mindfulness and thinking clearly. Being calm is a skill; the more often you put yourself in a calm state, the easier it will be to access and maintain it in your everyday life.</div>
<div class="class14">Being self-possessed means that you can navigate difficult situations with grace and remain in control of your feelings in <span id="calibre_link-1615"></span>
circumstances in which a person lacking such an ability would lose their head. By far the best way to develop this ability is by deliberately putting yourself in uncomfortable situations. The more you stretch your comfort zone, the less future situations will overwhelm you. A person who’s already been in a disagreeable situation several times, out of their own volition, will be less likely to lose their head when they involuntarily find themselves in such circumstances in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">A person who’s unable to remain patient &mdash; whether it’s with other people or when waiting for results to materialize &mdash; is more likely to make impulsive decisions that will sabotage their long-term goals. You need to train patience like a muscle. One way in which you can exercise your patience muscle is by engaging in activities that require patience or by learning a skill that takes a long time to develop. Slow progress will help you develop more humility and understand that some things can’t be rushed, no matter how hard you try to push them.</div>
<div class="class14">Being polite seems unrelated to the topic of self-discipline, but there’s one aspect of this trait that does affect your self-control: treating everyone as your equal. People who are impolite are in essence putting themselves above others, thinking that they’re superior. This arrogance can lead them to unnecessarily putting themselves in situations that test their willpower, which carries a higher risk of failure.</div>
<div class="class14">How do you become more polite? Easy. Assume that you aren’t better than others and try to learn from everybody. It’s impossible to <span id="calibre_link-1616"></span>
be impolite toward a person you consider your mentor, because that’s what every person can become for you when you embrace humility.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1617" class="class18">WEEK 30</div>
<div id="calibre_link-480" class="class19">Day 204: On Psychological Limits</div>
<div class="class20">The limit I thought existed was purely psychological. Now that I’d seen someone doing a thousand pounds, I started making leaps in my training. It showed the power of mind over body.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Arnold Schwarzenegger</span>
<span id="calibre_link-137"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-58" class="class23">202</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Our limits come primarily from our surroundings. If your role model of financial self-discipline is your uncle Jimmy (who somehow managed to save $500 this year), his example will set your own threshold &mdash; after all, he’s the only person you know who has managed to save money, so $500 saved in a year has to be a huge accomplishment.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s imagine that your uncle has been networking with the movers and shakers and invited you out to a dinner with Bob, an owner of a local chain of bakeries. Bob instantly takes a liking to you, and answers all of your questions with enthusiasm.</div>
<div class="class14">When you ask him how much a person should save during a year, he says that everyone can easily save at least $5000 a year, and that’s actually what he did for several years, in order to save enough money to bootstrap his business. Suddenly your psychological limits stretch and now in your mind, it’s $5000 that’s a lot and $500 feels like nothing<span id="calibre_link-1618"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">The same effect happens in virtually all areas of life, whether it’s finance, fitness, health, learning new skills, eradicating deeply-rooted negative habits or introducing new challenging ones.</div>
<div class="class14">Exposing yourself to high performers can be a wonderful way to push your psychological limits and show you what’s possible. Reading stories of average people like you or me who have managed to achieve their goals despite having no natural talent, resources, or any other hidden advantages works almost like brainwashing. What belonged to the realm of impossible is now something you know can be achieved.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Critics can get the best of even the world class top-performers with millions of fans.</div>
<div class="class14">Sadly, most of us have a tendency to focus more on a single instance of hatred than on a multitude of people expressing their love for ourselves or our work.</div>
<div class="class14">Fortunately, encountering hate can serve as a valuable exercise in building self-control. As Laurence Jones points out, it’s your choice as to whether you stoop low enough to radiate hate back, or ignore it and focus on something else that is more important.</div>
<div class="class14">When you meet with criticism, skepticism or sarcasm, receive it as an opportunity to practice self-control. Instead of responding to it, think of it as a minor annoyance that tests your patience. You have just “down-sized” it to a level where it’s just not worth your time or energy.</div>
<div class="class14">Just like you can practice restraint when you’re stuck in traffic, you can improve your self-control by disregarding hate. That way, you’ll get two benefits: you’ll improve your willpower and avoid ruining your mood by engaging in negative emotions.</div>

<div class="class14">No matter how passionate you are about your goals today, there will come a day when everything will suck and all you’ll want to do will be to give up. On that day, it won’t be feel-good enthusiasm that makes you continue. It will be dogged determination and the tenacity to finish what you begin that will carry you forward.</div>
<div class="class14">In a sense, enthusiasm is a fair-weather friend. By all means, you can have a great time with it when things are going well, but if you’re having problems, the only people you’ll be able to turn to would be your true friends, or in this case, perseverance.</div>
<div class="class14">I once spent a weekend in miserable conditions, on the brink of hypothermia, learning outdoor first aid &mdash; something I was initially enthusiastic about.</div>
<div class="class14">I can’t even begin to describe how tempted I was to end that torture and go back home. Nobody forced me to stay there. At any moment, I could have said that I was unwell and announced that I had to leave the camp early<span id="calibre_link-1622"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">However, doing so would have been to act against my most important values and to miss out on an opportunity to instill endurance in myself. In the end, I saw it through to the end. Even though the experience was hellish, I reinforced my habit of keeping going and staying the course, even when everything inside me is screaming to let it go and quit.</div>
<div class="class14">To train your endurance, vow to always see things through to the end. This will help you develop an empowering habit of sticking to your resolutions, come hell or high water.</div>

<div class="class14">In an ideal world, everybody would succeed more often than fail. In reality, failures are more common than triumphs, and so it means that the key skill is to learn how to profit primarily from your losses, not your successes.</div>
<div class="class14">And how do you do that? Simple. Whenever you fail, don’t just shrug it off and try again; carefully analyze what happened, what worked well and what didn’t, and what ultimately led to a failure.

</div>
<div class="class14">There exists a big temptation to put off quick tasks. After all, they’re easy and fast to do, so why do them now? Better to batch them and take care of them later.</div>
<div class="class14">However, ultimately this strategy can generate more work. The reason is simple: whenever you procrastinate about a quick task, you’re actually creating two tasks: the task in itself, and the task of remembering to do it. True, you can note it down, but it’s still another task to do. In the end, keeping track of it can cost more time than simply doing the task right away.</div>
<div class="class14">Moreover, quick tasks have a tendency to accumulate, and what originally would only take 5 minutes can ultimately take 3 hours, and then it suddenly becomes a problem to find so much time to get it all done.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, whether it’s a quick task or not, putting it off just because you don’t feel like doing it now creates a habit of procrastination. Remember that all of your behaviors contribute to who you are as a person. Procrastinating about small tasks leads to procrastinating about big goals<span id="calibre_link-1626"></span>

</div>
<div class="class14">It’s important to be future-oriented and prioritize future rewards over instant gratification. However, this statement is only valid to a certain point. If you live exclusively in the future, thinking that achieving some goal in the future is the only way to bring you happiness, chances are you won’t be happy either now or when you reach your goals &mdash; by then, you’ll come up with yet another event that must happen in order for you to be happy.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, it’s important to ensure that while your focus is on the future, it isn’t a condition for you to be happy.</div>
<div class="class14">For one, if you’re unhappy today, it will affect your well-being and make you less likely to reach your goals. Positivity breeds more positivity, while negativity spawns more negativity. A lack of happiness today can ruin your chances of making your future vision turn into reality.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, happiness is a habit &mdash; and just like any other habit, it requires some self-control to practice it. Activities like expressing gratitude for what you have, reframing negative events into valuable experiences, and drawing pleasure from the little things are all essential practices you need to engage in regularly to stay in top mental shape<span id="calibre_link-1628"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Last but not least, if you’re always waiting for some future occurrence, thinking that it will change your life, you’re essentially delegating the responsibility for your own happiness to some event happening (or not) in the future.

<div class="class14">Such a simple hack can provide tremendous benefits or even be the single thing that will finally make you stick to your diet in the long term.</div>
<div class="class14">I can attest to the benefits of this approach: when I was on a diet, I used to track my food intake to make sure that I hit my nutritional targets for the day.

<div class="class20">When you become ill, regard your illness as your teacher, not as something to be hated.</div>
<div class="class21">

</div>
<div class="class14">Nothing in life is more important than health, but we fail to understand this fact until we become ill and lose what we’ve been taking for granted for so long. At first, you deny it. Then you start wondering, “Why me?” Then you start hating it, and the more that negative emotions breed inside you, the more difficult it is to battle against the illness.</div>
<div class="class14">Many illnesses are preventable, or at least you can greatly reduce your risk for them by adopting healthy habits. Other illnesses can fall upon anyone, making your life miserable without it being your fault.</div>
<div class="class14">In both cases, setting aside the obvious fact that it would be better not to have it at all, an illness can serve as a teacher. In fact, regarding your illness as a mentor is the only way in which you can effectively cope with it. Denial, hate, regret, or frustration ultimately only work against you.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently dealing with an illness, look at it as an opportunity to review your life, your lifestyle choices, and your priorities. Take advantage of the fact that now you understand on a visceral level how important health is and make those healthy changes you’ve been postponing for so long<span id="calibre_link-1633"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, think of the illness as a challenge to overcome, and if it’s chronic and incurable, seek examples from people who live their lives to the fullest despite not being in the best health or physical condition: Nick Vujicic (a motivational speaker who was born without all four limbs), Sean Swarner (the first two-time cancer survivor to climb the seven highest peaks of the seven continents), Randy Pausch (a professor given three months to life who gave an inspiring lecture entitled “The Last Lecture” which went on to become a global phenomenon), or Jessica Cox (the first pilot without arms).</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1634" class="class9">Day 213: On Sudden Trials</div>
<div class="class20">The art of life is more like the wrestler’s art than the dancer’s, in respect of this, that it should stand ready and firm to meet onsets which are sudden and unexpected.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Marcus Aurelius</span>
<span id="calibre_link-809"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-808" class="class23">211</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Preparing yourself for possible temptations and avoiding situations in which you’re likely to encounter them is a solid strategy, but it won’t eliminate one of the most formidable enemies: sudden and unexpected trials.</div>
<div class="class14">During my krav maga workouts (an Israeli self-defense system), my coach often reminds me that during an attack in the street, I’ll be unlikely to be prepared for it. I may be carrying shopping bags, coming home after a tiring workout, feeling sick, or have my mind so occupied that I won’t notice the threat until it’s too late. Consequently, during our workouts, we sometimes imitate such situations so that I can be better prepared during an unexpected attack.</div>
<div class="class14">Self-discipline is similar to self-defense in this regard. It’s one thing to remain self-disciplined when you’re mentally prepared or perform a self-defense technique during training, and a completely different thing to face temptations or an enemy when they’re most likely to emerge &mdash; when you’re tired, angry, sick, heartbroken, or depressed.</div>
<div class="class14">As hard as it is, try to pay even more attention to your self-control when you aren’t at your best. It’s during those testing times <span id="calibre_link-1635"></span>
that you can learn the most about your weaknesses, as well as your hidden strengths.</div>
<div class="class14">To better prepare yourself to handle such negative, unpredictable circumstances, periodically test your character while you’re under the weather. For example, while writing these words, I’m pushing myself to complete two days’ worth of work even though I’ve been having low spirits the past few days. Even though it’s hard, I know that it will serve me well the next time I’ll have to deal with a different sudden, unexpected trial.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1636" class="class9">Day 214: On Fearing the Future</div>
<div class="class20">The only thing we know about the future is that it is going to be different.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Peter Drucker</span>
<span id="calibre_link-841"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-840" class="class23">212</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">A quick thought-provoking question for today: if you know for a fact that the future will be different, then what’s the point of fearing it?</div>
<div class="class14">When people fear that they will fail or succeed (fear of success is a real thing: success can change your life in many ways, and not always in the ways you expected, which makes it scary), they’re essentially fearing that their lives will be different, but it’s a fact anyway.</div>
<div class="class14">No matter what you do, your life <span class="class11">will</span>
 be different and you’ll have to deal with the aftermath of your life changing, no matter if you pursue your goals or not. If that’s the case, both fears are unfounded because a change is guaranteed anyway.</div>
<div class="class14">And not only that &mdash; <span class="class11">not</span>
 taking action because you’re afraid of the future is a worse choice, because when you pursue your goals, at least you have a certain amount of control over <span class="class11">how</span>
 your future will be different.</div>
<div class="class14">If you let fear overpower you, your future will still be different, but you won’t be able to steer it or know (with at least some accuracy) how it’s going to change.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you change your nutritional habits and start exercising more, you can predict with some accuracy that your <span id="calibre_link-1637"></span>
health will most likely improve, or at least not get worse. Can you predict what kind of health deterioration you will go through if you don’t make any changes?</div>
<div class="class14">What’s scarier, the prospect that you’ll become a different person through your new positive habits, or the prospect of not knowing if (and if so, what) disease, a health disorder, or another unpleasant thing will hit you?</div>
</div>


<div id="calibre_link-490" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1638" class="class9">Day 215: On Self-Determination</div>
<div class="class20">The most successful people, the evidence shows, often aren’t directly pursuing conventional notions of success. They’re working hard and persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to control their lives, learn about their world, and accomplish something that endures.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Daniel Pink</span>
<span id="calibre_link-873"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-872" class="class23">213</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Take a cue from the most successful people and figure out how to link your goals with the desire to control your life, learn about the world or accomplish something that endures.</div>
<div class="class14">How can your desire to build a business play into your need for autonomy, learning, or contribution? Easy. A business will give you financial freedom and let you control your life to the fullest extent. Growing your business will help you discover the parts of you that you’ve never known existed. And finally, building a successful business will leave a mark on the world; even if it’s a small one, it’s still a big accomplishment to build an organization of any kind.</div>
<div class="class14">What about dieting? How can you link something as mundane as caring for your body to such high desires? It isn’t that hard, either. Only a healthy person can control their life. A sickness can quickly remind you who’s the boss. Self-discovery? Go on a diet, explore how you feel when temptations arise, and you’ll get to know a lot about yourself. Accomplish something that endures? Change your body permanently and you’ll not only build something that hopefully lasts for a long time, but also discover how powerful a physical change can be for your mental state<span id="calibre_link-1639"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Now, think of your own goals and go through the same thought process, which will increase their significance to you and boost your determination.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1640" class="class9">Day 216: On Accounting for Flexibility in Your Plans</div>
<div class="class20">Another drawback of daily plans is that they lack flexibility. They deprive the person of the chance to make choices along the way, so the person feels locked into a rigid and grinding sequence of tasks. Life rarely goes exactly according to plan, and so the daily plans can be demoralizing as soon as you fall off schedule. With a monthly plan, you can make adjustments. If a delay arises one day, your plan is still intact.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Roy Baumeister</span>
<span id="calibre_link-909"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-908" class="class23">214</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">I’m a fan of daily routines: writing a specific number of words, sticking to the same number of consumed calories, or learning the same number of words in a foreign language every day.</div>
<div class="class14">However, at the same time, having experienced on more than a few occasions that life often doesn’t go exactly according to the plan and disruptions are bound to happen, I account for some flexibility in my plan. This way, when I mess up one day, it doesn’t have to affect my entire progress.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, whenever I’m tweaking my caloric intake, I try to focus more on what happens during an entire week or month than any specific day. This way, if I mess it up one day by eating too little or too much, it doesn’t matter because I can make up for it the next day or a week later. Granted, it carries the risk of making regular exceptions and setting a precedent, so it’s important to always plan exactly when you’re going to adjust for a day of variance<span id="calibre_link-1641"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Recently I set for myself a goal to write 10 daily entries for this book for 10 days so that after the end of this sprint, I will have written entries for 100 days, or almost 30% of the book.</div>
<div class="class14">If I were to only count it as successful if I stuck to writing 10 entries every day, without allowing myself any kind of flexibility, I’d have failed on the eighth day, which I spent outdoors. However, knowing that such a disruption would happen, I wrote 14 entries the day before my trip and 6 in the early morning before my departure.</div>
<div class="class14">Thanks to accounting for flexibility, I avoided the demoralizing effect of dropping the ball, and after 10 days, I had also completed my goal of writing 100 entries in total.</div>
<div class="class14">When setting new routines and goals, allow yourself some flexibility, too. If you have a daily quota, don’t immediately count it as a failure if you don’t perform it for one day. Work a little more for the next several days and instead of falling off the bandwagon, you’ll still achieve your original goal.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Living according to the most fundamental principle of Roman Stoicism &mdash; acknowledging that some things are up to us and others aren’t, and it’s of no use to worry or complain about the latter &mdash; is an excellent way to strengthen your self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">At the moment I’m writing this, I’m in the process of launching a new book. Things went bad from the start. I had to wait over 36 hours before my book was published, something that normally takes a few hours. This in itself delayed my entire launch schedule.</div>
<div class="class14">Then it turned out that because of another error, some early reviewers couldn’t post their review. Then I realized I forgot to upload my audiobook, which pushed back its release date. In the meantime, I had other fires to put out related to other aspects of the business.</div>
<div class="class14">I won’t lie: I was frustrated. However, in the end it all proved to be a valuable exercise in self-control. By trying not to get overly frustrated or worry too much about something that I couldn’t control, I became slightly better at handling such situations, which are bound to repeat in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you’re going through hardships that are beyond your control, look at them as an exercise in reining in your emotions. <span id="calibre_link-1643"></span>
There’s nothing you can do to change the situation, so at least you can learn something from it.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-494" class="class19">Day 218: On Protein in Your Diet</div>
<div class="class20">Potential beneficial outcomes associated with protein ingestion include the following: 1) increased satiety &mdash; protein generally increases satiety to a greater extent than carbohydrate or fat and may facilitate a reduction in energy consumption (…); 2) increased thermogenesis &mdash; higher-protein diets are associated with increased thermogenesis, which also influences satiety and augments energy expenditure (…); and 3) maintenance or accretion of fat-free mass &mdash; in some individuals, a moderately higher protein diet may provide a stimulatory effect on muscle protein anabolism, favoring the retention of lean muscle mass (…)</div>

<span id="calibre_link-978"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-977" class="class23">216</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Research suggests that one of the simplest ways to improve your adherence to a diet is to increase the amount of protein in it.</div>
<div class="class14">Protein is a miraculous macronutrient. It’s not only the body’s important building block, but is also more satiating than carbohydrates or dietary fat. Moreover, when on a diet, consuming higher amounts of protein helps to retain muscle mass.</div>
<div class="class14">Foods rich in protein include meat, fish, eggs, cheese, milk, yogurt, beans, nuts and seeds.</div>
<div class="class14">Making sure that your diet is rich in protein will help you lose weight, but also to maintain a healthy weight later on, so if your diet is mostly carbohydrate- and fat-rich, make some adjustments to include more protein-rich foods<span id="calibre_link-1645"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">However, be careful to not increase your overall calorie intake. When looking for potential high-protein foods, make sure that higher content of protein doesn’t come with higher amounts of fat (it’s a common combination).</div>

<div class="class14">However, if you want to become more productive and still have energy for your other goals, when you look at your to-do-list, in addition to thinking about when and how to do a certain task, ask yourself if you can drop it.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, one of my contractors recently pointed out there was a small mistake in one of my old books. I’m not going to lie. At first, I added it to my to-do list. But then, the next day, I realized that the error was so inconsequential that it made no sense to spend time fixing it. I had more pressing things to attend to, and my readers would benefit more from another book of mine released on time than me wasting time fixing a thing nobody had ever noticed before.</div>
<div class="class14">Look at your to-do list and be honest with yourself: how many tasks are there on your list because you put them there automatically, without even asking yourself if they’re important? How about dropping them to make more time for what matters?</div>

<div class="class14">On my journey toward building a successful business, I regularly read a document that described (in detail) the future in which my goals are accomplished.

<div class="class14">A common piece of advice to inspire you to pursue your ideal lifestyle is to find successful people whom you’d like to emulate.</div>
<div class="class14">However, what sometimes works better than positive motivation is negative motivation. For example, you’ll most likely run faster if you’re running away from a psychopathic killer than if you’re running in a race with monetary prizes.</div>
<div class="class14">In the same way, you might find more motivation in making a list of traits or describing the kind of a lifestyle you don’t want to live, identifying people you don’t want to resemble, and then using them as your antimodels.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you find yourself tempted to give up, cheat, or otherwise betray your values, remind yourself that each time you’re doing it, you’re getting closer to becoming your antimodel. If you’ve chosen your antimodels well, you’ll do whatever you can to avoid their fate &mdash; and that’s the power of negative motivation.</div>
<div class="class14">If you don’t know any people who can serve as antimodels, imagine your future self as a person who did the opposite of what you want and is now stuck in living the worst kind of a lifestyle that you could ever imagine. Treat the undesirable “future you” as your antimodel.</div>

<div class="class14">Some scientists (like Kelly McGonigal and Roy Baumeister) believe that willpower is a depleting resource. You wake up with a specific amount of willpower and it steadily decreases during the day until (in the evening) you’re supposedly no longer in control of your actions.</div>
<div class="class14">In their research, critics of this theory like Veronika Job and Carol S. Dweck pose that whether willpower is a resource or not largely depends on what you think about the issue.<span id="calibre_link-1129"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1128" class="class25">221</a>
 If you believe that your self-control is something that you use up during the day, that will be the case. If you believe it’s something that is with you whenever and wherever you want it, you won’t notice a drop in self-control over the course of the day.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of taking sides, I suggest being neutral about it. Even if your willpower is not a depleting resource, it’s better to perform your habits in the morning &mdash; not because your self-control will run out later on, but because things tend to happen during the day that will capture your attention and possibly make you forget about what you vowed to do in the evening. You might also simply get tired and don’t feel in the mood to push yourself once again<span id="calibre_link-1652"></span>

<a href="#calibre_link-6" class="class23">223</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">According to bestselling author Charles Duhigg, a habit consists of a cue (a signal to perform a habit), a routine (action), and a reward for engaging in the habit. This loop, when repeated over and over again, creates an automatic behavior.</div>
<div class="class14">When creating new habits, make sure that you have clear cues and rewards. This will help you introduce new routines with less resistance.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you want to start running every morning, keep your running shoes by your bed and before you leave, put your coffee mug on the table in the kitchen so that when you get back, coffee will serve as a reward for a job well done.</div>
<div class="class14">One thing to be aware of is that your reward can’t undo the benefits of the habit. If you want to reward yourself for exercising by eating a giant pizza, you’ll be taking one step forward and two steps back each time you engage in such a habit loop.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead, think of a healthier, less-caloric reward &mdash; a smoothie, some nuts, a piece of fruit &mdash; or something that has nothing to do <span id="calibre_link-1655"></span>
with eating, such as an hour spent reading a book, watching your favorite TV series, or taking a long bath. Please note that in the beginning a new habit like jogging in the morning can be unpleasant, but with time the action itself can be a reward (a workout can produce a feel-good endorphin rush).</div>
<div class="class14">Some effective cues include: another habit (like engaging in a positive habit after you finish brushing your teeth), a certain place (like getting back home after work and immediately sitting down to work on your side business for an hour), or a certain time (each day at 6 p.m. you spend fifteen minutes stretching).</div>

<div class="class14">For example, I went to college because my parents wanted me to do it. Graduating from college was, according to them, a necessity to succeed in life. I couldn’t care less about formal education, but they did, and since I was young and inexperienced, I obeyed.</div>
<div class="class14">Despite being a self-disciplined and persistent person, I didn’t last even two years. I dropped out, tired of constantly forcing myself to follow a plan that was not created by me. The day I decided to drop out was one of the happiest days of my life. It was also the moment when I finally embarked on my own journey, focused on my own goals<span id="calibre_link-1660"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If no matter what you’re doing, you’re finding it immensely difficult to pursue your goals, ask yourself if they’re really your own goals. Are you studying because <span class="class11">you</span>
 want to study? Are you a lawyer because it was <span class="class11">your own</span>
 choice? Do you want to make money to buy a house in the suburbs because it’s <span class="class11">your</span>
 idea of a perfect life or is it what society expects you to desire?</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t forget your dreams. Discard any goal or idea that was forced upon you by somebody else that isn’t aligned with your values and personality. Get to work on your own plans and then follow them instead.</div>

<div class="class14">Yet, I somehow managed to overcome all those debilitations and I turned out okay. One of the keys was not letting my dramatic story define me. Yes, I struggled with all those things and plenty more, but so did many other people &mdash; and many of them struggled with issues that make my problems look like a joke.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re using a past story as an excuse for what your life is like today, ask yourself how this strategy has been serving you.

<div class="class20">In racing, they say that your car goes where your eyes go. The driver who cannot tear his eyes away from the wall as he spins out of control will meet that wall; the driver who looks down the track as he feels his tires break free will regain control of his vehicle.</div>

<div class="class14">When you face hardships and feel like you’re about to crash, heed the advice of racing drivers: look at where you want your car to go, not at the wall you want to avoid hitting.</div>
<div class="class14">In practical terms, this means focusing on taking the next step to solve the difficult situation instead of busying your mind with worrying about what will happen if you don’t manage to succeed. Doing the latter is not only a waste of energy, it also actively works against you by convincing your brain that the failure is inevitable, thereby making it less likely that you’ll avoid it.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I was once close to being forced to close my business because I didn’t have sufficient money to keep it running. Instead of thinking about closing up shop and worrying about how it would affect my long-term goals, I focused on the next step I could take &mdash; doing whatever I could to secure some money to keep the business afloat. Instead of staring at the wall, I looked down the track and managed to avoid hitting the wall.</div>
<div class="class14">Adopt the same attitude when dealing with problems and setbacks. Obsessing about the imminent failure guarantees it, while <span id="calibre_link-1665"></span>

<div class="class14">When everything goes wrong, you might be tempted to think that everything is already lost. You’ve already made a mistake, you can’t go past the obstacles, the negative circumstances got the best of you.</div>
<div class="class14">There’s no denying the fact that chaos doesn’t make it easy to think logically. However, if you exert some willpower and force yourself to examine the situation without emotions clouding your judgment, you might discover new opportunities in the middle of chaos.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re on a diet and somehow one cheat meal turned into a week-long binge, you can conclude that everything is lost and give up. It’s the easy choice, but as we’ve already discussed on many occasions, easy choices are rarely the right ones.</div>
<div class="class14">The chaos that has ensued in your diet offers opportunities. For example, you can now jot down the thoughts you have when you gorge on unhealthy food after a long period of going without it. What makes you eat it? What’s the underlying motive? How can you satisfy your need for junk food without actually eating it?</div>
<div class="class14">If you’ve been following a healthy diet for several weeks, you can probably also notice the difference in how you feel after eating <span id="calibre_link-1667"></span>
crap. Whenever I spend a few days eating less healthily, I have a craving to return to my usual diet. Your mistake can then reinforce your will to part ways with junk food forever.</div>
<div class="class14">Treat chaos as an opportunity to learn, and you might benefit from it even more than if you had never found yourself in the middle of it.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-760" class="class23">231</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Thoreau was a big proponent of simplicity, particularly when it comes to material possessions. We can extend his maxim to living a successful life in general, namely that a human is strong in proportion to the number of things which he or she can let alone.</div>
<div class="class14">If you can still manage to achieve your goals despite not having the right resources, then ultimately you’ll become a stronger and more capable person than an individual who has never gone without them.</div>
<div class="class14">Kenyan javelin-thrower Julius Yego won the gold medal at the World Championships in Beijing. There would be nothing particularly interesting in this story except that he learned how to perfect his technique without a coach, and instead learned from YouTube videos.<span id="calibre_link-798"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-777" class="class25">232</a>
 Achieving such a feat without all of the resources that world-class javelin-throwers usually have demonstrates how capable and determined Yego is as an athlete.</div>
<div class="class14">Does it mean that you should deliberately reject the resources you have at your disposal? Not really. Look at it more as encouragement that, even if you don’t have the best tools available, you can still make it big<span id="calibre_link-1672"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to that, practice your mental strength by sometimes deliberately going without something you need.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I sometimes climb with a blindfold on. Without being able to see the next handhold or foothold, the sense of touch heightens, and it serves as a valuable exercise in improving precision when climbing.</div>
<div class="class14">You can apply it in many other areas of your life: sleep on the bare floor for a few days to discover that you can still get a good night’s rest once you get used to it, exercise without any equipment whatsoever, or try to learn a new skill by figuring it out by yourself instead of immediately looking for a coach or teacher.</div>

<div class="class20">I demolish the bridges behind me... Then there is no choice but to move forward.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Fridtjof Nansen</div>
<div class="class14">If working on your goals with a safety net makes you lazy and less likely to reach your goals, try the opposite approach: demolish the bridges behind you and go all in. You will either succeed or lose in a big way.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, before making such an extreme decision, take into account all of the risks. If you’re the sole breadwinner of your family, quitting your job to work on a business might not be an entirely good idea.</div>
<div class="class14">However, in many cases you <span class="class11">do</span>
 have an option to cut all escape routes.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you want to start a diet, you can throw away all of the unhealthy food you have in your house, pay in advance for three months of a healthy meal delivered to your doorstep, announce to all of your friends and family that you’re on a diet, and give your friend a substantial amount of money that he or she can spend as they like if you fall off the wagon.</div>
<div class="class14">If the only choices you have are a spectacular success or a spectacular failure, it often makes it easier to stick to your resolutions because the consequences of success and failure are <span id="calibre_link-1674"></span>
balanced. If you have a safety net and failure isn’t particularly hurtful, in a moment of doubt the temptation to back out can be too alluring to resist it.</div>

<div class="class14">What is a quote about forgiving doing in a book about self-discipline and success? The answer is simple: holding a grudge is like instant gratification. It gives you a little reward today at the expense of your future. Meanwhile, forgiving requires some sacrifice today, but eventually brings bigger benefits.</div>
<div class="class14">This means that the act of forgiving can serve as a valuable exercise in improving your self-control, particularly emotional control.</div>
<div class="class14">Engaging in negative emotions by staying angry at somebody who hurt you can give you some pleasure by satisfying your need for “fairness” in the world; expressing your dislike or anger is like punishing the one who erred.</div>
<div class="class14">However, in the long run, holding a grudge poisons only one person, and that person is you. Choosing to forgive &mdash; which doesn’t necessarily mean to <span class="class11">forget</span>
 &mdash; is therefore an act of freeing yourself from pain.</div>

It is going to be okay.” Like meditation, choose how to respond to the stress of a workout.</div>

<div class="class14">Pain isn’t you, and you aren’t your pain. Separating yourself from temporary pain is a crucial ability if you want to put yourself in uncomfortable situations for the sake of bigger and better rewards in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">Whether it’s exercise, dieting, work, or virtually anything else requiring effort, pain is sometimes inevitable. Depending on how you react to it &mdash; with panic or a calm inner conversation &mdash; you’ll either let it hinder your progress or you’ll defeat it and progress further.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, when I’m climbing a particularly difficult route, my forearms burn like hell, I can barely breathe, and my grip is so weak that I’m mere milliseconds from falling. Whenever I’m able to do so, I try to disassociate myself from the pain and try to advance my position further, even if I fall right after grabbing the next handhold. This way, I get to train my mental toughness and strengthen my ability to perform despite pain<span id="calibre_link-1690"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you feel temporary pain or discomfort, remind yourself that you can make the pain partly fade into the background when you mentally refuse to associate yourself with it. Obviously, make sure that the pain you feel isn’t a sign of an impending injury or that it can lead to an accident.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s perform a quick exercise…</div>
<div class="class14">Imagine your ideal future. To make it easier, for now focus on only one part of your life, say, your financial situation. You probably desire to have more money in the future. You want to be able to afford what you want and never have to worry about money again.</div>
<div class="class14">Now let’s focus on the present. Think about your choices today, yesterday, and the entire past week. Are they enabling the future you desire or disabling it?</div>
<div class="class14">Think of it as traveling on a toll road that will eventually take you to your desired future. At each toll booth, you need to pay to continue your journey. If you make the right choice, one that favors your ideal future, the toll barrier will open. If not, you’ll be stuck there, standing in front of the barrier until you can scrape something together &mdash; in this case, making the choices that enable the desired future.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you find yourself torn between instant and delayed gratification, think of sitting in a car in front of the toll booth. Do you want the barrier to open, so that you can continue your journey toward your goal, or are you fine with waiting and wasting your time?</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1693" class="class9">Day 242: On Selectivity</div>
<div class="class20">Few people take objectives really seriously. They put average effort into too many things, rather than superior thought and effort into a few important things. People who achieve the most are selective as well as determined.</div>
<div class="class21">

<span id="calibre_link-1091"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1090" class="class23">241</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Selectivity is one of the key attributes for success. Nobody in the world is good at everything. Most are exceptional at one, two, or perhaps three things, okay at several others, and mediocre or horrible at a multitude of other things.</div>
<div class="class14">When setting goals, ask yourself what kind of performance you demand from yourself. Would becoming merely okay satisfy you or are you seeking excellence? Prioritize your objectives accordingly.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s also important to determine the place each goal has in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I made a decision to become as good as I can in rock climbing, but not at the expense of my health. This meant that I had to forego certain other activities (such as tennis, in which I was horrible and had little hope for improvement), but it also meant that whenever I would find myself in a situation that was a potential risk to my health, I would back out.</div>
<div class="class14">Now I have an easy rule in climbing: if there’s a substantial risk of injuring myself in any way, I don’t push myself &mdash; and I don’t feel guilty when giving up. I made a conscious decision about the role of rock climbing in my life, and I won’t prioritize my <span id="calibre_link-1694"></span>
performance in it over what I consider much, much more important: my health and well-being.</div>
<div class="class14">Such clarity is important to help you understand how you should approach your goals when they clash with other aspects of your life.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to become a billionaire and run big businesses, are you so obsessed about this goal that you’re fine with possibly not starting family for a long time?</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to become a world-class athlete, do you accept the fact that professional sports will put immense stress on you and take a toll on your health?</div>
<div class="class14">Be selective with your goals, and once you establish which ones are the most important, ensure that you know where they all stand in terms of their priority in relation to other aspects of your life.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1695" class="class9">Day 243: On the Crime of Aiming <span id="calibre_link-1696" class="calibre2"></span>
Too Low</div>
<div class="class20">I will commit not the terrible crime of aiming too low. I will do the work that a failure will not do. I will always let my reach exceed my grasp.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Og Mandino</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1118"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1117" class="class23">242</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Aiming too low is in essence yet another manifestation of choosing immediate rewards over bigger rewards in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">You set your sights low, which ensures success and gives you some peace of mind from knowing that you’ll probably make it. However, at the same time, you limit your accomplishments. You get some comfort today at the expense of possible bigger rewards in the future.</div>
<div class="class14">The alternative is to set ambitious goals that make you feel uncomfortable because they carry a higher risk of failure. You suffer some discomfort today, but in the long run stand to gain more.</div>
<div class="class14">Which choice is more aligned with a person who values self-discipline in life?</div>
<div class="class14">Please bear in mind that you shouldn’t confuse aiming high with being unreasonable. If you have no idea what is possible and what is not, start slowly with a safe, easily attainable goal, and aim higher only when you understand the odds of making a more ambitious goal become a reality<span id="calibre_link-1697"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">As a rule of thumb, if you’ve already been working on a particular area of your life for several months or years, you probably know what is easy to achieve, what is realistic and what might be beyond your reach. If you’re new to something, it’s unlikely that you can determine that right away without first gaining some experience.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I know (from my experience in business) that, in a six-month timeframe, it’s an easy goal to make $100 a month from an online business, a realistic goal to make $500 a month, and a “stretch” goal to cross $2000 a month.</div>
<div class="class14">At the opposite end of the spectrum is golfing. I don’t know anything about it, so instead of setting an ambitious goal (something I can’t do properly because I don’t understand the odds), I can only focus on an easy, attainable goal (such as learning the basics of how to hit the ball properly), and only begin to aim higher after I have understood the fundamentals.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1698" class="class9">Day 244: On the Fun in the Impossible</div>

<span id="calibre_link-1142"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-175" class="class23">243</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Continuing the topic of aiming high, there’s another benefit of doing the impossible: it’s more fun than being realistic, and since it’s so much fun, the excitement it generates supercharges your motivation to make it a reality.</div>
<div class="class14">As we’ve already discussed, this obviously isn’t about setting completely impossible goals. Becoming a billionaire in five years is unlikely if you’re starting from zero, but becoming a millionaire &mdash; while also unlikely and impossible for most, isn’t actually impossible.</div>
<div class="class14">While it isn’t necessarily a good idea to set several impossible goals in your life, it’s worth it to have one goal that borders on the line between what’s possible and what’s impossible.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I set a goal to make enough money to build a countryside house for my parents while I had just a few pennies in my wallet. You could have said it was an impossible objective back then, and you’d be right &mdash; except that I <span class="class11">did</span>
 manage to accomplish it in the end, and I owe a lot of my personal drive to this bold, inspiring goal. I doubt that I would have had the same resolve if I had set a safer, more realistic goal<span id="calibre_link-1699"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to test (on a smaller scale) the concept of impossible goals fueling your resolve, set a small goal with a short deadline. Write a full-length novel in two weeks. Learn a foreign language in three months. Make $5000 on the side in six weeks. It’s a fun experiment, and if you treat it seriously, you might be surprised at what you can accomplish if you dream big.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-110" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1700" class="class9">Day 245: On Following or Leaving a Path</div>
<div class="class20">Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore you must always keep in mind that a path is only a path; if you feel you should not follow it, you must not stay with it under any conditions. To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life. Only then will you know that any path is only a path and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you to do. But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition. I warn you. Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Carlos Castañeda</span>
<span id="calibre_link-138"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-111" class="class23">244</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">A path is a tool, and it’s only useful as long as it’s getting you closer to your goals. When it stops serving you, don’t feel obligated to follow it to the end or you might end up in the bushes, scratching your head while staring at your scraped knees.</div>
<div class="class14">The key to making an intelligent decision about whether to leave the path or continue following it is to make that decision when you’re free of negative feelings. People often give up their paths when they’re struggling, and while they’re in pain, they fail to notice there’s a reward waiting just around the corner.</div>
<div class="class14">Another danger is sticking to the same path out of ambition or ego. “I’ll see it through to the end,” an ambitious individual proclaims, while it’s clear that they should have changed the path a long time ago. They refuse to give up out of the fear of others <span id="calibre_link-1701"></span>
laughing at them, or in fear of themselves coming to feel as if they had betrayed themselves.</div>
<div class="class14">I suggest periodically reviewing your path, but only after first ensuring that you’re in a neutral state of mind. Ask yourself if your strategy is still delivering results. Does it still feel right to you? Do you still see yourself following it for another month, quarter, or year? Paths, like any other tool, sometimes need to be changed.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-518" class="class19">Day 246: On Learning the Big Ideas</div>
<div class="class20">You have to learn all the big ideas in the key disciplines in a way that they’re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use them for the rest of your life. If you do that, I solemnly promise you that one day you’ll be walking down the street and you’ll look to your right and left and you’ll think “my heavenly days, I’m now one of the few competent people in my whole age cohort.” If you don’t do it, many of the brightest of you will live in the middle ranks or in the shallows.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-48" class="class23">245</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">All human knowledge is interconnected on some level. The big ideas can often be applied to general life. For this reason, it pays to develop at least a basic understanding of the key concepts of some of the most important disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, biology, psychology, engineering, history, etc.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s take compound interest, one of the most important big ideas in investing. When the interest you earn each year is added to your principal, your returns each year grow at an ever increasing rate. It might sound boring on paper, but in the real world it’s what has made many investors millionaires or billionaires.</div>
<div class="class14">This big idea can be applied to personal growth, too. You never want to grow at a fixed rate; if you constantly build on top of your new experiences (interest), you’ll grow at an ever-increasing rate. <span id="calibre_link-1703"></span>
Your personal growth might be relatively slow the first year, but each succeeding year, you’ll get better and better results more quickly.</div>
<div class="class14">Strive to educate yourself in a broad variety of fields and focus primarily on the fundamentals. Try to find a real-world application of those principles in your own life. Even if you don’t always find it, self-education alone will be a valuable exercise in self-discipline.</div>

<div class="class14">When the first-order consequences are unpleasant, second-order consequences will usually make up for them. If it’s the other way around and something has good first-order consequences, it’s possible it will be bad for you in the long run.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re about to take it easy for the rest of the day and skip a workout, the first-order consequence is that you get to relax and do something more pleasant. However, the second-order consequence is that you miss a day of exercise, which will potentially affect your routine and in the long haul, lead to your returning to your old, inactive and unfit self.</div>
<div class="class14">There’s more to each decision &mdash; no matter how small &mdash; than just how it’s going to make you feel immediately. If you fail to account for the second-order consequences, you’ll never learn how <span id="calibre_link-1705"></span>
to discern between ultimately meaningless immediate gratification and the power of delaying rewards for a better outcome in the future (or vice versa &mdash; you won’t be able to see that the pain or discomfort today can lead to immense benefits in the future).</div>

<div class="class14">Instead of giving 10 speeches this quarter, you’re thinking about reducing it to 7 or 5. It’s still a lot of speeches, you’re still getting better as a public speaker, so why not rethink your targets and make them a bit more manageable?</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of hitting your target weight when dieting, you cut yourself some slack and settle with a weight 10 pounds (or 5 kilos) higher than your desired goal.</div>
<div class="class14">I don’t entirely agree with Grant Cardone. Sometimes rethinking your targets is the only intelligent thing you can do &mdash; particularly if you’ve set unrealistic targets and the alternative is to give up altogether.</div>
<div class="class14">If, however, your goals are within your reach and you’re otherwise feeling fine, but still making up excuses so you can let <span id="calibre_link-1707"></span>
yourself off the hook, it’s time to tap into your willpower resources, resist the temptation to take it easy, and start taking even more action.</div>
<div class="class14">If you choose the easy way out, you’ll set a precedent: each time you feel challenged, you’ll simply reduce your goals, and thereby never explore where your limits actually are.</div>

<div class="class14">If you feel like you are spinning your wheels, frustrated by the impossibility of discovering what the first step should be, start from the other direction.</div>
<div class="class14">Imagine yourself as a person who has achieved your goal. Now work backwards: what have you done to get to where you are? What have you avoided doing? What are you doing daily as the successful person who has accomplished this goal? What are your beliefs? How do you feel?</div>
<div class="class14">Break it down into small parts and now you have a list of all of the actions you need to take to get to your destination. Start with an action you think is within your reach and take it from there.</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s go through a quick example to better describe this process. Let’s imagine that you want to become a fit, healthy person.</div>
<div class="class14">What would this person certainly <span class="class11">not</span>

certainly <span class="class11">not</span>
 do. Now you have a list of smaller and bigger habits you need to implement in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">How would this person feel about themselves and which beliefs would they embrace? Would you agree with me if I said that they would probably feel firmly in control of their destiny and that their primary belief would be that they’re the masters of their own fate and they would never blame anyone else but themselves for not living up to their standards? Now you know where you need to start to change your identity.</div>
<div class="class14">An additional benefit of this exercise is that you get to visualize all of the actions that are necessary to achieve the change; unlike visualizing the outcome alone (which is generally ineffective), this type of visualization can be helpful in boosting your resolve.</div>

<div class="class14">Many people have an erroneous belief that work &mdash; both in the literal sense as well as work on your personal goals &mdash; has to involve a lot of effort and struggle. Consequently, their bodies reflect their attitude. As Dale Carnegie points out, they scowl when they concentrate, hunch up their shoulders and tense their muscles.</div>
<div class="class14">In reality, tensing is counter-productive. A good example comes from my rock climbing experience: whenever I get too tense and rigid when climbing, my performance decreases, and by a big factor. I forget about proper technique, find myself unable to breathe, and just like that, I can no longer hold onto the wall and I’m falling.</div>
<div class="class14">The same goes with work. I do my best work not when I’m scowling and punching myself in the face, trying to bring out my creativity. I work best in the early morning when I’m sitting <span id="calibre_link-1714"></span>
somewhere outside in sunny, warm weather, with a cup of tea or water by my side. The environment relaxes me, unleashes my creativity and my productivity shoots up.</div>
<div class="class14">Design your environment in such a way that it relaxes you instead of making you tense. Whenever you catch yourself too tense at work, relax. Make a conscious effort to work with poise.

In brief, he compels his mind to believe that he is getting older and older, and thereby directs the mind to produce more and more age. The true expression in this connection is, “The longer I live.” This expression calls the mind’s attention to the length of life, which will, in turn, tend to increase the power of that process in you that can prolong life. When people reach the age of sixty or seventy, they usually speak of “the rest of my days,” thus implying the idea that there are only a few more days remaining. The mind is thereby directed to finish life in a short period of time, and accordingly, all the forces of the mind will proceed to work for the speedy termination of personal existence. The correct expression is “from now on,” as, that leads thought into the future indefinitely without impressing the mind with any end whatever.</div>

I myself know a rock climber who’s in his sixties or seventies, and yet (even after a complicated surgery) he is still climbing, and doing so better than many young people<span id="calibre_link-1716"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t use the process of aging as a rationalization for why you can’t reach your goals. It’s true that getting older comes with a higher risk that your body won’t function as well as it used to, but it doesn’t mean that now you should retreat from life.</div>
<div class="class14">Do the best you can with what you have, surround yourself with people who are mentally young (regardless of their biological age), and there’s no risk you’ll ever turn into those bitter, cranky old people who are living their lives while waiting for physical death (because <span class="class11">mentally</span>

<div class="class14">For example, when I was overweight, I rejected the notion that I was too fat. I was Big Martin. I sure as heck wasn’t Overweight Martin. What’s wrong about being big? One day, I saw my predicament for what it was: a prison with bars that would only move closer to me, if I continued to delude myself that I wasn’t actually overweight.</div>
<div class="class14">If you can’t generate such an epiphany yourself, it might be worth it to expose yourself to some constructive criticism from a professional &mdash; a doctor, a fitness instructor, a business mentor, or a life coach &mdash; in order to see your blind spots, or rather, take your blinders off and stop lying to yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">Are there any aspects of your life about which you lie to yourself? Is there something that you think is generally considered <span id="calibre_link-1718"></span>

Talents</div>
<div class="class20">Overcoming deficits is an essential part of the fabric of our culture. Our books, movies, and folklore are filled with stories of the underdog who beats one-in-a-million odds. And this leads us to celebrate those who triumph over their lack of natural ability even more than we recognize those who capitalize on their innate talents. As a result, millions of people see these heroes as being the epitome of the American Dream and set their sights on conquering major challenges. Unfortunately, this is taking the path of most resistance.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Beware of applying your self-discipline where it’s least likely to make a positive impact. If something is your weakness and it’s not a matter of life or death (like healthy nutritional habits or regular physical activity are), it might make more sense to give up than to try to conquer something in which ultimately you’ll never be good.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I’m a natural introvert. I don’t use it as an excuse not to socialize or have poor communication skills, but I’ve accepted that I don’t recharge when I’m in a large group of people.</div>
<div class="class14">Consequently, I don’t strive to become the life of the party because it clashes with my personality. Instead of forcing myself to socialize as much as it’s possible against my nature, I decided to focus on a different aspect of my communication skills: better communication in one-on-one conversations<span id="calibre_link-1721"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">This way, I can still improve myself, but in a way that will bring better results than trying to triumph over something that isn’t (and never will be) my natural ability.</div>
<div class="class14">In the case of working on your strengths or weaknesses, taking the path of <span class="class11">most</span>
 resistance is the wrong choice. Focus on your strengths, and become as good as you can in what naturally comes to you, as that’s where you’ll benefit most from increased self-discipline.<br class="calibre" />

<span id="calibre_link-843"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-842" class="class23">254</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Your self-image directly affects your self-discipline and virtually everything else in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">If you think of yourself as a lazy person, how likely is it that you will engage in productive behaviors? The picture that you hold of yourself on the inside won’t match your intended actions. Whenever people feel their actions aren’t congruent with themselves, they stop engaging in them.</div>
<div class="class14">On the other hand, if you think that (deep down) you’re productive, you’ll feel good when you manifest that in the real world. At the same time, whenever you catch yourself being lazy, you’ll feel that it clashes with your personality and subsequently, do whatever you can to avoid it.</div>
<div class="class14">Negative self-image keeps you away from making a change, while positive self-image creates a virtuous cycle. Whenever you’re setting new goals, start with your self-image. What do you think of yourself in relation to the goal you want to pursue?</div>
<div class="class14">What if, instead of calling yourself a failure in business, you’d call yourself a person with many experiences to draw from?</div>
<div class="class14">What if, instead of thinking of yourself as a person with weak self-control, you’d call yourself a person deeply motivated to build self-discipline<span id="calibre_link-1723"></span>

</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s a simple rule: don’t conclude that a decision has been made until you’ve taken a real-world action that reflects it.</div>
<div class="class14">Examples:</div>
<div class="class14">If you decided to change your nutritional habits, no real decision has been made unless you physically get rid of junk food from your house and prepare a healthy meal.</div>
<div class="class14">If you decided to start saving money, you haven’t really decided unless you have put some savings in a saving jar or wired some money to a separate savings account.</div>
<div class="class14">If you decided to start a business, the decision will only become real when you start physically working on your product or service or you get busy selling it.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t fall victim to the erroneous belief that making a decision is merely saying some words in your head. The decision only becomes real in the moment you take a real-world action and can no longer easily back out by pretending that you were just “thinking” about making a decision.</div>

<div class="class14">Self-control has a wide variety of applications, one of which is the control you have over your own words. Negative habits like gossip, harsh unconstructive self-criticism, telling half-truths or speaking without integrity are all manifestations of a weak-willed person.</div>
<div class="class14">A person who’s in control of their speech, who makes sure that their words are used primarily to tell the truth or are motivated by love and other positive emotions, will spread positivity and respect. This, in turn, will make the other person feel better, too, and it all creates a positive chain reaction. Moreover, controlling your words and making sure that whenever you open your mouth, you bring value to the world, is in itself a powerful exercise in self-restraint.</div>
<div class="class14">On the other end of the spectrum, a vile person who constantly gossips about others, hides what they think, and uses their words to hurt others, will ultimately live a bitter, gloomy life.</div>
<div class="class14">Being impeccable with your word is a big challenge, and possibly a lifetime endeavor, but it’s well worth the benefits. Start <span id="calibre_link-1726"></span>

<a href="#calibre_link-946" class="class23">257</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">You can help others in two ways: help with no expectation for getting anything in return but the pleasure of helping, or help in a calculated way, expecting a reward.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, some situations require scratching each other’s back. It would be foolish to help someone without expecting a clear compensation in return if you’re conducting a regular business transaction.</div>
<div class="class14">However, many trivial everyday situations are opportunities for learning to exhibit the other approach: offering help with no strings attached.</div>
<div class="class14">This type of help is a valuable exercise in learning self-discipline because when you make difficult choices, you won’t always have a guarantee of a future reward. Helping for the sake of helping is a powerful exercise in learning that it’s worth it to do something positive for the sake of doing it, and not necessarily for immediate compensation.</div>
<div class="class14">Nobody is going to jump out of the corner with a trumpet, clapping their hands and congratulating you for making the right <span id="calibre_link-1729"></span>
choice when you skip dessert. However, just like when helping with no strings attached, doing it anyway (without others’ congratulations or expressed approval) can help you learn to draw pleasure from the mere fact of doing something that you know is good for you.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to that, looking for opportunities to help others will help you develop the mindset of a successful individual &mdash; a person who’s constantly on the lookout to contribute more to the world.</div>

<div class="class14">Without a doubt, one of the most difficult challenges for self-discipline is getting out of the warm, comfortable bed early in the morning, when you’re still half-asleep, only partially able to think logically.</div>
<div class="class14">Curiously, in my personal experience, this rarely happens if I’m on a vacation. I might even jump out of bed, eager to start another exciting day.</div>
<div class="class14">I’ve found that if I don’t have any particular expectations for the day in front of me, I struggle to get out of bed. Whether you’re self-disciplined or not, a lack of something you’re looking forward to during the day will make it hard to get out of bed.</div>
<div class="class14">Each evening, before going to sleep, think about a convincing reason to get out of bed early &mdash; or set an ambitious long-term goal on which you’ll work daily that will ensure that each day you’ll have a reason to get up.</div>
<div class="class14">Unless the reason is more exciting or pressing than sleeping in, you’ll probably have a hard time getting out of bed. Note that <span id="calibre_link-1731"></span>
nothing &mdash; including fancy clocks, tracking your sleep phases, or putting your alarm across the room &mdash; will be as helpful for your self-control in the morning as having a good reason to wake up.</div>

<div class="class14">Here’s a little trick to inspire courage to make a change: prepare a list of the consequences of acting and not acting. List all the great things that will happen if you change and all the bad things that will happen (or keep on happening) if you decide not to act.</div>
<div class="class14">Aim to make the list of the consequences of not acting so terrifying that the only valid choice would be to act. In essence, that’s what courageous people often do in a split second: they see something that fills them with fear and do it anyway because ultimately not facing their fears is an even scarier proposition.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re afraid to change your job, imagine what will happen if you don’t act. You’ll have to continue working in a job you may even hate. Day by day, week by week, it will probably get even worse. The same faces, the same annoying tasks, the same frustrating boss. Isn’t that prospect scarier than looking for a new job?</div>

<div class="class14">Consequently, here’s another challenge for your self-control: instead of always trying to one-up somebody else, give up having the last word. Don’t try to prove that you’re better (you aren’t) or that your opinion is right (even if it is, you won’t convince anybody by arguing with them). Agree to disagree and change the topic to something more pleasant.</div>
<div class="class14">Exercising self-restraint this way will not only improve your relationships with others, it will also help you improve your self-control by learning how to resist one of the strongest temptations: to continue to argue your case when you’re convinced of your rightness.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">There’s no doubt that modern comforts make our lives easier. However, while the benefits are clear, there are also disadvantages of living in so much comfort: we rarely get to experience the discomfort our ancestors had been dealing with on a daily basis, and consequently, we are less able to handle it when it manifests in our lives.</div>
<div class="class14">That’s why I’ve mentioned more than several times throughout the book how important it is to voluntarily put yourself in uncomfortable situations. One additional thought that is related to this topic is to think of experiencing discomfort as a vaccine.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I’ve fasted so many times on so many occasions that now whenever I find myself in a situation in which I’m forced to fast for some reason, I don’t mind it. I’ve essentially immunized myself against the need to eat often, and this has made me a stronger person.</div>
<div class="class14">The immunization you get from practicing discomfort quickly adds up, making you more resilient in all areas of life. Think of the ways in which you make yourself fragile through always choosing <span id="calibre_link-1736"></span>
comfort over discomfort, and every now and then temporarily forego that comfort, in order to toughen up.</div>

<div class="class14">Agreeing with somebody simply because of their position or reputation is dangerous, because you’re essentially delegating your thinking process to this person. I make mistakes, you make mistakes, and even the world’s most successful performers make mistakes.</div>
<div class="class14">Moreover, what works for one person doesn’t necessarily work for another person. For example, I often take the extreme approach, which usually works out fine for me, but might hurt another person who isn’t used to pushing their limits in such a way. Granted, you won’t know which approach is good for you until you test it for yourself, but it’s important to think before you act and to question any advice, including the tips you find in this book.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, don’t make the mistake of letting others decide the meaning of your life. You, and only you, can figure out how you <span id="calibre_link-1739"></span>
want to live your life and what you want to get out of it. Following somebody else’s recipe for an “ideal” life is a recipe for depression. Even if your dreams are considered weird by others, it doesn’t make them incorrect. They’re <span class="class11">your</span>

<div class="class14">When people create something themselves &mdash; say, a birthday card for a friend &mdash; they value it more than something created by somebody else. Similarly, people take ownership of their ideas and feel they’re more valuable simply because they’re their own ideas.</div>
<div class="class14">You can use this phenomenon to improve your self-discipline. Instead of relying on <span class="class11">my</span>
 definition of self-discipline, come up with your own. Jot down what self-control means to you, when you feel it, how you feel it and why is it important to you. I can write all day long how important self-discipline is, but if you do it yourself and apply it to your personal situation, you’ll immediately understand it on a deeper level.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to reading the tips and tricks I share in this book, come up with your own ideas. You’ll be more likely to act on your own ideas than on the ones that you learned from me or from any other person.</div>
<div class="class14">I usually give two or three applications for every piece of advice, but it’s rarely limited to just those two or three uses. Think about <span id="calibre_link-1748"></span>
how you can adapt the lessons to your own life or even test the opposite way of doing things &mdash; there’s rarely, if ever, only one correct method.

g</div>
<div class="class20">The benefits of stretching are enormous. Stretching can increase your strength by 10%. It is a lot. The man [Russian Master of Sports Alexander Faleev] explains that “when you lift a weight your muscles contract. And after the workout the muscles remain contracted for some time. The following restoration of the muscles’ length is what recovery is. Until the muscle has restored its length, it has not recovered. Hence he who does not stretch his muscles slows down the recuperation process and retards his gains.” Besides, tension and relaxation are two sides of the same coin, “if the muscle forgets how to lengthen, it will contract more poorly. And that is stagnation of strength.”</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s your willpower exercise for the week: stretching. Stretching isn’t only great for your physical health; since it’s generally uncomfortable but provides long-term benefits, it’s also great for your self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">I strongly suggest always beginning a workout with dynamic stretches (short stretches, usually with some kind of a dynamic motion) and concluding each training with static stretching (holding a stretch for a longer period of time, usually at least 15&ndash;30 seconds).</div>
<div class="class14">Static stretching is better for exercising your willpower because that’s where you actually need to hold a stretch and keep at it, even though it’s uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="class14">5-10 minutes of stretching a few times a week, focused particularly on the tightest areas (probably your hips, lower back and hamstrings) is a good target. If you don’t know how to stretch, a <span id="calibre_link-1751"></span>

<div class="class14">When people are new to personal development, they tend to think more than act. They spend more time reading than actually implementing advice.

</div>
<div class="class14">When you’re new to the world of personal development, you read whatever you can grab your hands on. Every single classic, every book recommended to you by somebody you respect, every new bestselling release. At first, it’s a fine strategy: you get to expose yourself to different authors, learn the fundamentals, and look at personal development from different perspectives.</div>
<div class="class14">However, as time passes, you should leave some books behind and progress to more specific advice. For example, I used to read one general self-help book after another. Soon I found them all similar to each other. Each new title added little to my knowledge. I outgrew those books, and needed to find a new teacher.</div>
<div class="class14">I transitioned to reading books about a more specific topic than general personal development: how to change myself to become a successful entrepreneur (and how to actually start and run a profitable company), how to improve my communication skills, how to eat healthily, or how to develop focus.</div>
<div class="class14">Then I started reading more biographies and autobiographies, where the lessons usually aren’t as clearly laid out as in a regular how-to book, but which are unique and more insightful, related to a <span id="calibre_link-1755"></span>
specific problem the person portrayed in the biography had dealt with.</div>
<div class="class14">Recently I started expanding my horizons and seeking out books about specific problems I struggle with (for example, how to develop a better life philosophy) and reading books from other domains, so I could draw parallels from them and apply their principles to my own life.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of different categories of books as your development stages. When a given type of a book no longer serves you, find a new teacher.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1756" class="class9">Day 272: On Extinguishing Bad Habits</div>
<div class="class20">You can never truly extinguish bad habits. Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. That’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-679"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-678" class="class23">271</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Some time ago we talked about the habit loop: a cue (a signal to perform a habit), a routine (action), and a reward for engaging in the habit. This loop, when repeated over and over again, creates an automatic behavior.</div>
<div class="class14">You can use this loop to create new habits, but you can also use it to replace bad habits with more empowering routines.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, instead of always eating a chocolate bar during a lunch break, eat a banana. Your cue is a lunch break and your reward is eating something sweet. Two parts of the habit loop remain the same, but are now satisfied by a healthier alternative.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of always dealing with a stressful situation by emotional eating, head out for a quick run. Your cue is feeling stressed, and as a reward you get to reduce or eliminate the anxiety. Running can become an alternative, healthy way of satisfying your need for self-comfort<span id="calibre_link-1757"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">If you have any bad habits you want to get rid of, think about how to keep your cue and reward the same while replacing the negative routine with something empowering. You’ll reduce the risk of reverting to the old habit because it will only be the action in itself that changes &mdash; not your cue or the reward.</div>

<div class="class14">If you not only want to become a champion, but also <span class="class11">stay</span>

<div id="calibre_link-1764" class="class9">Day 276: On the Price of Personal Growth</div>
<div class="class20">Personal growth has its price, and she was paying it without complaint.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-863" class="class23">276</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">As we’ve discussed it in yesterday’s entry, staying a champion means that you’ll always need to put yourself in new, uncomfortable situations. It’s the price you have to pay for excellence.</div>
<div class="class14">Personal growth in general has its price, too. From my personal experience, here are several things you should expect on your journey toward improving your life:</div>
<div class="class14">1. People being confused about your actions. Unless you’re surrounding yourself solely with top performers, your immediate social circle will probably be puzzled why you’re subjecting yourself to discomfort, prioritizing work over enjoying yourself, or rejecting pleasures today for the sake of tomorrow. The sooner you learn to ignore those voices, the better off you’ll be.</div>
<div class="class14">2. Outgrowing certain people in your life. It’s painful, but you’ll probably outgrow some friends or loved ones. You’ll find it harder to connect with them and they’ll find it harder to connect with you. This doesn’t necessarily have to happen in every situation and with everyone, but prepare yourself for the reality that some of your relationships will probably weaken or stop being as fulfilling as they used to be<span id="calibre_link-1765"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">3. An incessant desire to improve everything. Once you start making positive changes in your life and experience in your own skin how powerful new habits and attitudes can be, you’ll feel the desire to improve everything. This can be a source of frustration when you realize that certain people don’t want to change or that certain social mores actually value mediocrity over excellence.</div>
<div class="class14">4. Self-guilt that you have it better than other people. As strange as it sounds, if you successfully introduce some important changes in your life &mdash; develop a healthy physique, form positive nutritional habits, set aside some savings and find meaningful work you enjoy or at least one that satisfies you financially &mdash; you might start feeling guilty that others have it worse.</div>
<div class="class14">Considering that most people are either obese, unhealthy, broke, or unhappy at work, chances are you that you will indeed live a better life than they are living. However, in the end you gained the right to enjoy the life you have now through your own efforts. Don’t feel guilty because you made better choices. Other people could have done the same.</div>
<div class="class14">5. A difficulty to enjoy what you have. The more you achieve in your life, the more you’ll want to achieve. When you notice that something is lacking in your life, you’ll want to change it. This carries the risk that you’ll never be able to enjoy what you have or unrealistically expect that everything and everyone needs to be perfect. Sooner or later (ideally sooner) you’ll need to learn how to be grateful for what you have and be content with it.</div>

Frozen veggies are often picked in the peak of their season, too.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-900" class="class23">277</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s the ultimate hack when it comes to eating more vegetables: eat ones that have been frozen. At least 50-60% of vegetables I eat have been frozen (the rest are canned and fresh). Research shows that nutrition-wise, frozen vegetables aren’t worse &mdash; and might be even better &mdash; than fresh vegetables.</div>
<div class="class14">One of the biggest issues when it comes to improving your eating habits is a lack of time or being too lazy to prepare fresh vegetables. You can get rid of this excuse by buying a frozen vegetable mix. Steam it, sprinkle it with some good herbs and spices and voila! You’re getting your veggies for the day with no need to go through the entire ordeal of peeling, washing, and cooking fresh vegetables (for which you might not have enough willpower).</div>
<div class="class14">Please note that this entry isn’t merely about frozen vegetables; it’s about making sure that your new positive habits are as convenient to stick to as possible<span id="calibre_link-1767"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">The more convenient you make it to stick to a healthy diet, the more likely you’ll be to stick to it. Even if one day scientists discover that frozen or canned vegetables aren’t as healthy as the fresh ones, it’s still better to eat them than not eat vegetables at all because it’s too inconvenient for you to eat them fresh.</div>
<div class="class14">The same applies to other goals. Yes, it would be ideal if you found a fun outdoor activity, but if you really can’t afford to do so, buying some basic equipment and exercising at home (to make it more convenient) is still better than not exercising at all.</div>
<div class="class14">When you’re choosing between failing to stick to a positive habit because it’s inconvenient or making it more convenient but perhaps a little bit less effective, choose the latter.</div>

<div class="class14">As Thomas Sterner points out, we don’t remember things that we achieved easily &mdash; and often, they don’t even make us particularly happy or we don’t consider them significant.</div>
<div class="class14">Working hard and patiently to achieve an important but difficult goal isn’t just an unpleasant thing that you need to do to get to your destination &mdash; it’s life itself, a state a human being needs to feel fulfilled and inspired. A life without challenges is neither happy nor does it lead to you realizing your full potential.</div>
<div class="class14">See your current hardships for what they are &mdash; a powerful opportunity to embrace your human nature, grow as a person, and an awesome inspirational story you’ll be able to share with others in the future.</div>

<div class="class20">The ten thousand questions are one question. If you cut through the one question, then the ten thousand questions disappear.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Xinxin Ming</div>
<div class="class14">Analysis paralysis happens when you overthink a situation to such an extent that you never take a decision.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, a person who wishes to lose weight will never commence a diet because they’ll forever keep searching for the right diet or the ultimate answer to the question of which foods are healthy and which are not (hint: even scientists don’t know the correct answer).</div>
<div class="class14">As a result, weeks and months pass by, and all you have is more and more unresolved questions and zero real-world results.</div>
<div class="class14">While it often pays to think deeply about your goal and how you want to approach it, if you have a tendency to over-analyze and overcomplicate things, give yourself just one day to figure out the answer to one key question &mdash; and instead of aiming for the perfect answer, aim for an answer that’s <span class="class11">good enough</span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you want to start a diet and are unsure which one to follow, research the most common and most successful diets. Limit your choices to the few best options and then choose the one that feels like the best fit. Don’t worry about getting it perfect &mdash; in the state of analysis paralysis you won’t get any results, so even mediocre results are still an improvement<span id="calibre_link-1778"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of it as driving a car in foggy weather. Even though you can’t see everything around you, you can still drive. It’s the same with goals &mdash; even with limited knowledge, you can still work on your objectives.</div>

y</div>
<div class="class20">Stay hungry. Be hungry for success, hungry to make your mark, hungry to be seen and to be heard and to have an effect. And as you move up and become successful, make sure also to be hungry for helping others. Don’t rest on your laurels.</div>

<a href="#calibre_link-1060" class="class23">282</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">One of the biggest dangers of success is that when people achieve it, they frequently lose the hunger that has led them to demonstrate the incredible amounts of willpower and determination it took to make their dreams come true. As a result, they run a huge risk of losing the success they’ve worked so hard to achieve.</div>
<div class="class14">If you don’t want to be like those people, once you’re done celebrating your success, find another source of hunger that will make you pursue new challenges and continue to grow. Set bigger goals, or find a deeper meaning behind your actions. Discover a new itch to scratch, to keep yourself always learning more.</div>
<div class="class14">Note that always searching for a new source of hunger doesn’t mean that you can’t ever be content with what you have. It’s not about constantly chasing the carrot, dissatisfied with what you have. It’s about making your life ever so much larger, while being appreciative and protective of what you have.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I’m extremely grateful for my successes in the self-publishing world &mdash; and for people like you reading my books &mdash; and precisely because of that, I still push myself. I know that it’s only through constant effort and through producing new works that I can reach even more people and achieve new goals. Writing new <span id="calibre_link-1781"></span>
books protects my success and lets me grow as a writer, constantly taking things to the next level. Should my hunger for writing disappear one day, I’ll find a new reason to be hungry in a different area.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t let comfort persuade you that challenges aren’t important in life. When there’s nothing difficult that you’re striving to achieve, you will eventually lose your hard-earned achievements, habits, and traits &mdash; and along with it, the comfort that you’re now enjoying.</div>

<div class="class14">Few, if any, self-help authors would challenge the opinion that habits are of key importance to a person wishing to improve their life. Most would agree that good habits unlock success, while negative habits are destroying you.</div>
<div class="class14">Yet, sometimes even positive habits can act like handcuffs that limit your life and choices to a preselected set of routines that you’ve decided are most optimal for you.</div>
<div class="class14">Is waking up early generally a positive habit? It is. It can become like handcuffs, though, if you assume that now you need to wake up early every single day, even if there’s a special occasion to celebrate the evening before, such as your spouse’s birthday.</div>
<div class="class14">Is eating healthy a positive habit? Of course it is. However, it can act as shackles if you never let yourself lower your guard for a while and enjoy (preferably in great company) whatever food strikes your fancy.</div>
<div class="class14">Is being highly productive and always working on something new a good habit to have? It is &mdash; but if you never relax or get a little lazy, you’ll miss out on some valuable experiences in life and eventually burn out.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever forming new habits, establish rules as to when you’ll allow yourself to temporarily forego them. Self-discipline and <span id="calibre_link-1784"></span>
positive habits are important, but life isn’t about living like a robot that always follows the same routines, no matter what.</div>

<div class="class14">In fact, some of those small things (such as reminding yourself to have a good posture or avoid cursing), when done repeatedly, can deliver immense personal changes because they force you to be more mindful of your everyday actions. By pausing yourself intermittently throughout the day to control your small behaviors, you develop more mindfulness, and consequently, more self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">Here are some little exercises you can consider adding to your everyday routine to improve your self-discipline, even when you’re strapped for time:</div>
<div class="class14">- keep your back straight when working;</div>
<div class="class14">- every hour, stand up and do five bodyweight squats;</div>

<div class="class14">A common reason why people procrastinate about something that they consider extremely important to them is exactly that &mdash; they consider it so crucial that it overwhelms them and paralyzes their actions.</div>
<div class="class14">When you think of something as your only big chance in life, you’ll understandably try to tread as carefully as possible. This, however, can quickly convert into procrastination when your fear of ruining the opportunity will prevent you from taking action.</div>
<div class="class14">If you currently find yourself in such a situation, ask yourself what is the end result of putting off this big, once-in-a-lifetime chance in life. Isn’t procrastinating about it going to lead to the exact same thing you’re afraid of &mdash; losing the opportunity?</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever setting new resolutions, manage your attitude about them so that you aren’t overwhelmed by them.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of it as having an opportunity to meet a famous person. You can hold them in high regard, but it doesn’t mean that you have to act like a crazy fan around them. In fact, that’s what will put them <span id="calibre_link-1791"></span>
off, while a person who treats them as another human being will be a welcome difference.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s the same with your goals. Yes, they might be so important that they will change your life. However, this will only happen if you keep a cool head about them. Otherwise you can let them overwhelm you to such an extent that you’ll altogether fail to act.</div>

<div class="class14">As Ryan Holiday notes, there are taxes on traveling, relationships, and financial success, but they aren’t limited just to those areas.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to become healthier, one of the taxes is that you’ll have a harder time when you eat in a social setting.</div>

<div class="class14">When faced with heartbreaking losses such as a business going bankrupt, a lost job opportunity, a breakup, or even your new diet going south, it’s hard to see it as a possible blessing in disguise. After all, you’ve just lost something &mdash; a business, a relationship, a job, or hope for improvement.</div>
<div class="class14">As an immediate reaction, it might be challenging to <span class="class11">not</span>
 feel bad about the situation. However, once you process that it <span class="class11">has</span>

<div class="class14">Maybe a breakup was necessary so that you can start over again and find a different, better partner. Maybe your business had to go bankrupt so you could free up your resources to focus on a better idea.

<div class="class14">I once invested several thousand dollars in an extensive coaching course. I thought that since I was already an author, it wouldn’t be that different to become a coach, too. I spent over a month learning from that course, and ultimately gave up with little to show for it.</div>
<div class="class14">After a month of studying, I didn’t feel I knew that much more about coaching to be able to coach &mdash; and it didn’t matter, because I knew that I wouldn’t do it, anyway. My idea to become a coach was a mistake. I realized that my strengths lie in writing books, and not in giving personalized advice. Continuing my education would have been continuing to invest my time and energy into something that was destined to fail anyway. I cut my losses short and refocused on writing.</div>

<div class="class20">Part of abandoning the all-or-nothing mentality is allowing yourself room for setbacks. We are bound to have lapses on the road to health and wellness, but it is critical that we learn how to handle small failures positively so that we can minimize their long-term destructive effects.

<div class="class14">It’s easy to see that there’s only one outcome of this mentality: you do nothing because no matter what you do, you won’t get your perfect results right away. Even if you do start, one setback will discourage you from further efforts: after all, it’s all or nothing and since you just suffered a failure, it’s time to give up as you won’t be perfect anymore.</div>
<div class="class14">Avoid developing such a mindset in yourself by acknowledging that everybody has to first be bad at something in order to become good at it. No world-class performer started out with incredible <span id="calibre_link-1808"></span>
skills; they all fumbled and failed on their journey toward success. If you don’t believe me, read some autobiographies.</div>
<div class="class14">If you managed to get past the all-or-nothing thinking and started working on your goals, but small slip-ups discourage you from further efforts, tell yourself that you only have to adhere to your resolutions in 90% of your efforts. The remaining 10% is your margin for mistakes.</div>
<div class="class14">That way, one slip-up won’t destroy your entire progress: after all, you’ve already accounted for it, so it’s not ruining your forecast result.</div>

<div class="class20">We are engineered as goal-seeking mechanisms. We are built that way. When we have no personal goal which we are interested in and which “means something” to us, we are apt to “go around in circles,” feel “lost” and find life itself “aimless,” and “purposeless.” We are built to conquer environment, solve problems, achieve goals, and we find no real satisfaction or happiness in life without obstacles to conquer and goals to achieve. People who say that life is not worthwhile are really saying that they themselves have no personal goals which are worthwhile.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">If you’ve been wandering aimlessly, asking yourself what’s the point of life and feeling like you have no purpose, it’s possibly because you don’t have any important long-term goals to achieve.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever I found myself in such a situation, it was always during a transitory period between finishing work on one important goal and looking for a new challenge.</div>
<div class="class14">When you reach an important long-term goal, by all means celebrate it, but don’t give yourself more than a couple of weeks to set a new challenge. Failing to identify a new exciting target and living your life without any big goals eventually leads to depression.</div>
<div class="class14">I’m talking from my personal experience: if I don’t have a guiding star in the form of a significant long-term goal, I lose motivation for everything, including my passions<span id="calibre_link-1810"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, I always have secondary goals. Whenever I accomplish my primary goal and don’t immediately come up with a new primary goal, I promote one of the secondary goals to become my new objective.</div>
<div class="class14">I strongly suggest creating a “waiting list” of goals to achieve, so that when you find yourself without a goal, you’ll be able to quickly refocus on a new challenge.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">The thoughts you entertain most often will have the biggest impact on who you are as a person. If you think about your business every day, you’ll define yourself as an entrepreneur. If you have negative thoughts every day, your attitude will be negative. If every day you blame everything and everyone but you for your problems in life, you’ll self-identify as a victim.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, it’s a good exercise to periodically take stock of your most habitual thoughts and their potential impact on who you are as a person.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I recently discovered that I had been engaging in too many negative thoughts. While those negative thoughts usually represent a small percentage of the thoughts I have, lately they had multiplied. Using Marcus Aurelius’s words, I don’t want to let them dye my soul black, so I’ve made a decision to focus on cultivating more positive thoughts and weeding out the negative ones.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of the most common thoughts you’ve been engaging in recently and ask yourself if they represent the kind of a person you want to be. If not, it’s time to exert some self-discipline and regain control of your mind.</div>

Work</div>
<div class="class20">I do my best thinking at night when everyone else is sleeping. No interruptions. No noise. I like the feeling of being awake when no one else is.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Jennifer Niven</span>
<span id="calibre_link-813"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-812" class="class23">295</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">The best time to work &mdash; and by work, I mean work on your highest priorities, not necessarily your day job, with hours that you can’t control &mdash; is a highly individual matter, but for most people there are only two choices for maximum productivity: early morning, when people aren’t awake yet, or late at night, when everyone is already asleep. The common denominator is the lack of interruptions that can ruin your concentration in a matter of seconds.</div>
<div class="class14">Early mornings have the advantage of being easier to combine them with a normal everyday schedule. Even if you wake up at five in the morning, you can still lead a regular life: go to work or attend other obligations during the day with plenty of energy, spend time with family and friends during the afternoon, and every now and then stay up late and enjoy the evenings.</div>
<div class="class14">Unlike the way most self-help slogans go, staying up late doesn’t mean that you’ll never reach success, but in general it’s more difficult to maintain this schedule when compared to waking up early<span id="calibre_link-1814"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">For one, most humans don’t handle night shifts well because we’re programmed to sleep when it’s dark and be active when there’s light. Second, having to sleep during the day means missing out on many social events. Moreover, a typical employee can’t afford to stay up late; they need to be at work at 9. In the long run, it’s impossible to survive 8 hours of work after only a couple of hours of sleep.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, working at night is most suitable to people with flexible schedules. I used to follow such a routine &mdash; I worked until 3-4 a.m. and woke up around 1-2 p.m. In the end, I switched my routine and took the opposite approach. While I was generally productive while working at night, my mental health and energy levels visibly deteriorated, due to a deficiency of sunlight and a messed-up circadian clock.</div>
<div class="class14">Still, it’s good to test both approaches and see which one is most suitable for you. The key is to find a period of time when you feel most productive and able to concentrate.</div>

Mantras</div>
<div class="class20">The Yogic sages say that all the pain of a human life is caused by words, as is all the joy. We create words to define our experience and those words bring attendant emotions that jerk us around like dogs on a leash. We get seduced by our own mantras (I’m a failure... I’m lonely... I’m a failure... I’m lonely...) and we become monuments to them. To stop talking for a while, then, is to attempt to strip away the power of words, to stop choking ourselves with words, to liberate ourselves from our suffocating mantras.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-845"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-844" class="class23">296</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Self-talk can build you up or it can drag you down. If each day you repeat in your head the mantra that you’re a failure or you’re lonely, guess what you’re going to get… Success and companionship? Think again. You exhibit actions congruent with your inner self-talk. If you consider yourself a failure and a lonely person, that’s what you’re going to get: more failure and loneliness.</div>
<div class="class14">Be aware of the suffocating mantras in your life. Liberate yourself from suffering by refusing the negative self-talk. Each time you tell yourself something negative, seek the proof of the opposite.</div>
<div class="class14">When you say to yourself, “I’m a failure,” think of one &mdash; just one &mdash; situation in which you succeeded. How can you be a failure if you experience successes?</div>
<div class="class14">When you say, “I’m weak-willed,” think of one &mdash; just one &mdash; instance in which you managed to overcome a temptation. You <span id="calibre_link-1817"></span>
might not have the level of self-discipline you desire, but it doesn’t mean that you’re automatically too weak-willed to change.</div>
<div class="class14">Strip away the power of negative mantras by citing (in your head) the evidence against them. Repeat this evidence as a sort of a “counter-mantra” so that you can, instance by instance, weaken the grip of the negative mantra and eventually free yourself of it.</div>

<div class="class20">I often wonder why the whole world is so prone to generalise. Generalisations are seldom if ever true and are usually utterly inaccurate.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Agatha Christie</span>
<span id="calibre_link-877"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-876" class="class23">297</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Generalizations demonstrate lazy thinking, and lazy thinking is one trait that you most certainly don’t want to have if you want to improve your self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">Resist the temptation to categorize everyone and everything. Acknowledge that &mdash; besides black and white &mdash; there are all kinds of shades of gray.</div>
<div class="class14">One of the most dangerous types of generalizations is assuming that a frequently repeated opinion is a fact. Examples include:</div>
<div class="class14">1. Every salesman is a liar wanting to make as much money as they can on every sale. If that’s the generalization you believe, how effective will you be at selling your own services or yourself to a potential employer?</div>
<div class="class14">2. All men/women are horrible people. Good luck developing happy relationships with people if you categorize every member of the opposite sex as a horrible person.</div>
<div class="class14">3. All successful people got lucky. If that’s what you believe, do you think it’s possible you’ll ever achieve success?</div>
<div class="class14">4. The only way to become properly educated is to go to college, and (what usually follows that generalization) your education ends <span id="calibre_link-1820"></span>
the moment you graduate. Without lifelong learning, achieving and maintaining success will be a tricky proposition.</div>
<div class="class14">5. You need to be white/wake up early/start a business/be rich/live in the United States/be male/fill in the blank to become successful. Be cautious not to equate success with a single trait or habit. Warren Buffet drinks five cans of Coke every day.<span id="calibre_link-913"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-912" class="class25">298</a>
 Does it mean that drinking Coke leads to success and longevity?</div>
<div class="class14">Catch yourself whenever you proclaim generalizations that masquerade as facts. Unless you can state beyond a reasonable doubt that everything or everyone is the way you describe it (and it takes only one thing or person to prove otherwise), you’re only voicing an opinion.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Walking is not only a fantastic exercise that almost everybody can perform, but also a powerful way to awaken your creativity and boost your problem-solving skills.</div>
<div class="class14">I strongly suggest adding the habit of walking regularly &mdash; even if it’s just 15 minutes &mdash; to your weekly schedule. For even better results, pick a route leading you through natural surroundings or at least away from the hustle and bustle of city living.</div>
<div class="class14">I like to take walks with a specific intention in my mind. For example, I think of a problem I’ve been struggling with recently and dedicate my entire walk to brainstorming potential solutions. I sometimes listen to important podcasts when walking because I know that if it weren’t for the walk, I wouldn’t listen to them with as much focus as they deserve.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t underestimate the power of this simple exercise to change your life. Walking gives you an opportunity to move your body, recharge, reflect, and potentially resolve difficult problems that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to handle in your distracting, day-to-day life.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1823" class="class9">Day 301: On the Power of Rituals</div>
<div class="class20">A growing body of research suggests that as little as 5 percent of our behaviors are consciously self-directed. We are creatures of habit and as much as 95 percent of what we do occurs automatically or in reaction to a demand or an anxiety.</div>
<div class="class21">

<span id="calibre_link-982"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-981" class="class23">300</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">If the vast majority of what we do is an automatic behavior, then what we need to focus on in the first place is making sure that our rituals are empowering. But first, we need to identify and assess our automatic behaviors.</div>
<div class="class14">Starting from when you wake up, make a list of all of the automatic behaviors you engage in throughout the day.</div>
<div class="class14">Do you immediately go to prepare coffee? When commuting to work, do you always swear at other drivers? When you arrive at work, do you automatically start gossiping with your colleagues? When shopping, do you automatically buy things you don’t necessarily need if you see that they’re discounted by 50%? When you’re tired but there’s still one more chore to attend to, do you routinely watch TV first and then take care of the chore (or forget about it entirely) or do you do it immediately, instead of giving in to the temptation to procrastinate?</div>
<div class="class14">This simple exercise will help you take stock of your rituals and decide which ones to keep and which ones to discard. Since automatic behaviors often take place without us being entirely aware of them, making such a list may help you discover your blind spots<span id="calibre_link-1824"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to performing this exercise, pick one day during which you’ll try to catch yourself whenever you’re automatically engaging in disadvantageous behaviors. It’s only with heightened self-awareness that you can identify some of the little everyday habits that negatively affect your willpower.</div>

<div class="class20">You might find the idea of listening to your gut feelings odd or even ridiculous. Some people I coach, normally left-brain individuals who use logic and facts all day like engineers or accountants, are not used to following their intuition and feelings. Instead of asking themselves “What do I feel?”, they are more comfortable asking “What do the facts tell me?”</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Using logic and facts is essential in accomplishing your goals, but sometimes it’s important to listen to your gut, instead of what you can determine through using a rational thinking process.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I was once running a company in a profitable industry, with a good and proven business model. There were many possibilities for growth, clients enjoyed the service, and it was probable that (with enough persistence) I would get venture capital funding and expert coaching.</div>
<div class="class14">However, in my gut I felt that the business wasn’t for me. It clashed with my personality, and no amount of rational thinking, facts, and logic would have persuaded me otherwise.</div>
<div class="class14">In the end, I sold the company and it proved to be the right decision, a decision that was based primarily on my intuition and feelings, not logic.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t ignore the usefulness of your gut feelings. It’s fine to be self-disciplined and remain persistent no matter what, but if deep <span id="calibre_link-1826"></span>
down you no longer care about your goal or it otherwise makes you feel uneasy, let your intuition make its case. It’s highly probable that it’s right.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1827" class="class9">Day 303: On Buddha’s Counsel</div>
<div class="class20">The Buddha also counseled the monks and nuns to avoid wasting any precious time by engaging in idle conversation, oversleeping, pursuing fame and recognition, chasing after desires, spending time with people of poor character, and being satisfied with only a shallow understanding of the teaching.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Thich Nhat Hanh</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1045"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1044" class="class23">302</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Buddha’s advice offers several interesting challenges you can dedicate yourself to in order to work on your self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">The first one is not engaging in idle conversation. Small talk might be useful to initiate a conversation, but the sooner you get to the business at hand, the more effective your communication will be. By “idle conversation,” we can also include gossip, criticizing others, or complaining, all of which are <span class="class11">not</span>
 practices in which a disciplined person should engage.</div>
<div class="class14">The second suggestion is simple: avoid oversleeping. As long as you don’t need more sleep to recover from a difficult workout, illness, or any other similar situation, sleeping too much doesn’t deliver any benefits and, according to scientific research, might even hurt (in one study, sleeping too much was associated with psychiatric diseases and higher body mass index<span id="calibre_link-1073"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1072" class="class25">303</a>
).</div>
<div class="class14">The third suggestion advises against the pursuit of fame and recognition. Too often, people care too much about their status in other people’s eyes and neglect other, more important aspects of their lives, which may only be visible to themselves. Focus on <span id="calibre_link-1828"></span>
becoming better, but not necessarily with the expectation that somebody will reward you for it.</div>
<div class="class14">The fourth recommendation is not to chase after desires. There’s not much to add here &mdash; this entire book is about learning how to control them and focus on something more important than your temporary urges.</div>
<div class="class14">The fifth piece of advice pertains to structuring your social life in a disciplined way. Spending time with people of poor character increases the risk that you’ll develop a poor character, too.</div>
<div class="class14">Lastly, Buddha reminds us not to be satisfied with only a shallow understanding of what we’re learning. This advice is particularly useful for students and virtually any person learning a new skill. Resist the temptation to learn just the bare minimum and only scratch the surface of the topic you’re learning before you leave it altogether. Use your willpower to make sure that you thoroughly understand the fundamentals and then proceed to more advanced concepts, so that you deepen your understanding of what you are seeking to learn.</div>

<div class="class14">Some people believe that super-productive individuals have some kind of a secret or a natural inborn talent that allows them to produce so much output. However, the reality is unsexy: all they do is put themselves in front of their computers (or whatever else they need to do their job), close the door, and work.</div>
<div class="class14">There are no miraculous solutions, no pills, frameworks, or blueprints that the most productive people have to be able to produce more than you do. When reading his masterpieces, it’s difficult to imagine Stephen King simply sitting in his room and tapping away on his keyboard, but that’s how his day-to-day life looks.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re unsure whether you’re doing it “right” because there’s nothing attractive nor particularly outstanding in how you perform your daily work, stop worrying; everyone else &mdash; including world-class performers &mdash; works in the exact same way. The only difference between you and them is that they have spent a bit more time than you have, working on their craft, but there’s a level playing field here that requires the same resources from every participant: self-discipline, persistence, and an unbreakable resolve.</div>

The deep, immersive thinking which produced many of civilization’s most important achievements has come under unprecedented assault. We are almost never far from a machine that guarantees us a mesmerizing and libidinous escape from reality.

<div class="class14">Yet, there exists a danger of becoming addicted to electronics. Smartphones reduce our attention spans, easy access to information makes us too lazy to learn, and since it’s now so easy to get new things delivered to your doorstep, we’re constantly looking for a new shiny thing that will be the ultimate magic pill and solution to all of our problems.</div>
<div class="class14">I don’t believe that technology is our enemy, but I do believe that too much of it &mdash; as with excess in anything &mdash; leads to problems. Fortunately, where there’s a problem, there’s an <span id="calibre_link-1832"></span>
opportunity to learn. You can dramatically improve your self-control by periodically reducing the amount of time spent using your phone or other devices.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, while you’re on vacation, resist the temptation to take a picture and share it on Facebook. Instead, focus on the present moment and engrave it in your memories, not your social feed.</div>
<div class="class14">In the evening, at least every now and then, turn off all of the blue-light emitting devices and spend an hour reading a book. You’ll have an easier time falling asleep, and it will be more recharging, too.</div>
<div class="class14">Whenever you catch yourself feeling anxious to check your phone or social media feeds, it’s a sign that you’re losing control. Reestablish it by periodically going on short technology fasts or deliberately checking your phone less often than usual.</div>

<div class="class14">Disregarding important information and choosing to <span class="class11">not</span>

<div class="class14">It’s important to note that those principles aren’t for the times when everything goes smoothly. In fact, you don’t necessarily need them when things are going well. It’s primarily when there’s a temptation to give up that you can experience the power of rules. You create them to prevent yourself from making the wrong choices, no matter what the circumstances are and which temptations you feel.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I have a rule that growth happens outside my comfort zone. I don’t always feel like subjecting myself to discomfort and fear.

<div class="class14">I don’t have money, so I won’t start saving money because how can I save money if I don’t have it?</div>
<div class="class14">I don’t have money, so I won’t start eating more healthily because healthy food is too expensive.</div>
<div class="class14">Is it really true that nobody has ever become fit without having loads of money? The marketing techniques of the fitness industry lead you to think that expensive gear is needed to get fit, but many do without it (often as their own choice), and are more than fine.</div>
<div class="class14">Are you really unable to save even one dollar a day, just to establish a new positive habit? Are you saying that your every single purchase is necessary and can’t be reduced even by a small fraction?</div>
<div class="class14">Is healthy food really more expensive than junk food? Ask any person taking hypertension or diabetes medication &mdash; caused by their own bad dietary choices &mdash; whether they think that eating junk food was a more economical choice. You don’t need to eat all organic or shop in expensive stores to eat healthily<span id="calibre_link-1839"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Using money as an excuse is taking the easy way out, defaulting to mental laziness rather than seeking a solution. True, it helps you avoid some effort and hard thinking today, but costs you future improvements in your life and leads to a victim mentality.</div>

<div class="class14">More than 70% of U.S. adults aged 20 and over are overweight or obese.<span id="calibre_link-134"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-133" class="class25">309</a>

 Does that mean that it’s right to spend a third of your waking hours and well over a half of your leisure hours watching TV?</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re after self-improvement, you need to acknowledge that the right thing is right even when few people are doing it &mdash; and that no matter how many people are doing the wrong thing, it’s still wrong.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t comfort yourself by saying that your negative habits aren’t <span class="class11">that</span>

Teachers</div>

<span id="calibre_link-253"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-216" class="class23">311</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Here’s one of the ultimate shortcuts for success: if you want to learn something or achieve a goal more quickly, find a good private teacher to guide you. Spend your money eagerly on one-on-one instruction, because expanding your knowledge and experience (unlike many other investments) is a sure-fire way to get a positive return.</div>
<div class="class14">Group classes are extremely ineffective teaching tools because the teacher’s attention is spread over too many students. If you have an hour-long class with a teacher and there are 9 other students, on average you only get 10 minutes of the teacher’s attention. Even if the teacher’s fee for a private class is five times higher, it’s still cheaper than a group class, considering how much more you’ll learn.</div>
<div class="class14">Consider hiring a coach for any important endeavors or to kickstart a new change. For example, you can hire a nutrition expert to develop a meal plan for you or a fitness coach to design a workout plan for you. You don’t necessarily have to keep paying them forever; the initial help can be sufficient to get you started and then <span id="calibre_link-1844"></span>
all you have to do is continue to practice what you learned from them, until your needs change.</div>
<div class="class14">One additional benefit of hiring a private coach is that once you start paying to get professional help, you’ll start taking your objectives more seriously. It’s easier to back out if there’s nobody to whom you need to give an explanation as to why you want to give up.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Does it bother you that people laugh at your efforts, wonder why you’re deliberately making your life so difficult, or feel otherwise puzzled about your recent efforts at making positive changes in your life?</div>
<div class="class14">Save your time and energy trying to reason with them &mdash; it won’t work. Instead, focus on your goals and set an example. Soon, when you achieve some results, people will start following your example, understand why you’re doing what you’re doing, or at least shut up.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, people criticized me when I was on my diet, saying that I was already skinny and shouldn’t lose more weight. However, I knew that I had to drop some additional pounds to uncover more muscle definition. Once I reached that goal and my muscles became more visible, it became clear that I had been right from the get-go.</div>
<div class="class14">No amount of reasoning will make people change their minds in the same way as an example standing right in front of them.</div>
<div class="class14">Similarly, don’t try to persuade people to implement positive changes in their lives just because that’s what you’re doing. Leave them be, and if they notice your results, some will probably ask you for advice and try to achieve the same results themselves. Again, it’s about setting the example, not expending empty words.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1846" class="class9">Day 312: On Learning Without a Desire to Learn</div>
<div class="class20">Just as eating contrary to the inclination is injurious to the health, study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Leonardo da Vinci</span>
<span id="calibre_link-680"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-664" class="class23">313</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">You can learn almost anything you want as long as you have a desire to learn. Without a good reason why you want to learn something &mdash; or worse, being forced to learn it with no interest whatsoever on your part, as is often the case with college students &mdash; you’ll retain little of what you learn.</div>
<div class="class14">The reason is simple: the human brain needs to be picky about what it remembers and what doesn’t, so if you consider a fly on the wall as more exciting than the subject of your study, you’ll be more likely to remember the fly’s position during the entire hour of the class than the topic of your lesson.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I once took a few Russian classes to prepare myself for a trip to Kyrgyzstan, a rugged mountainous country in Central Asia.</div>
<div class="class14">However, unlike with Spanish, a language I speak fluently and am fond of, I couldn’t develop an interest in Russian. My classes weren’t particularly effective because, deep down, I had little desire to learn that language; there was no positive emotional connection with it<span id="calibre_link-1847"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">That’s why I so strongly emphasize that each endeavor &mdash; including the goal of learning a new skill &mdash; needs to start with a strong desire. If you don’t have that, you’ll be fighting an uphill battle.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re forced to learn something and are struggling, try to find something interesting about the subject. For example, you might find that Russian grammar is not particularly interesting, but perhaps trying to improve your accent in it is fun for you.</div>
<div class="class14">You can also use educational resources that teach in an entertaining way. YouTube videos can be a good source for that. When it comes to learning languages, I’m a big fan of watching TV series that are broadcast in that same language.</div>
<div class="class14">If you still can’t find anything exciting in learning the topic itself, turn toward the reward it offers you, such as a promotion at work or being able to graduate from your learning program, and use <span class="class11">that</span>
 (the reward) as your sole motivation. Be careful, though: extrinsic motivators are weak motivators, and it’s always better to combine them with internal rewards, like the enjoyment you get from learning or from the challenge it poses for you.<br class="calibre" />

</div>
<div class="class14">It all comes down to what you demand from life. Accept nothing less than abundance and prosperity, and if you combine it with diligent work, you’ll eventually get it. Tolerate misery and poverty, come up with rationalizations about why you’re miserable, and bad fortune will stay in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">It’s important to understand that it takes virtually the same amount of effort to come up with excuses as it is to find reasons why you <span class="class11">can</span>
 accomplish something. You can direct your energy either way, but only one of them leads to success.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you catch yourself thinking that you’re destined to be unsuccessful and that you should accept your bad fortune, change your thoughts: remind yourself about how dissatisfied you are with your current circumstances and come up with reasons why you <span class="class11">will</span>
 be successful instead of continuing as you are.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, while I was trying to build a successful business and failed one time after another, I still kept reminding myself that I would never tolerate being an employee. Nothing would have <span id="calibre_link-1849"></span>
stopped me from making my goal come true; I would never accept anything else than abundance and prosperity.</div>

<div class="class14">Here’s an easy self-discipline hack for today: clean your immediate surroundings and benefit from improved self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">A messy desk &mdash; and the unpleasant thought in the back of your head reminding you that eventually you’ll have to clean it &mdash; occupies precious mental space you could otherwise spend on something more useful. Chaotic immediate environments are also distracting, and thus lower your productivity.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to taking up both physical and mental space, clutter can also affect how you feel about yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">People feel better when they take a shower, shave their faces, put on make-up or perform any other grooming habit &mdash; and they feel worse when their appearance is not up to their standards.</div>
<div class="class14">A messy room has a similar effect: it indicates that the person working there isn’t organized or lacks the self-discipline to keep it tidy. Keeping your room neat and tidy demonstrates in a physical way that you <span class="class11">are</span>
 organized and self-disciplined &mdash; and that will subsequently affect your inner world, too, just like dressing for success gives a small boost to one’s confidence.<br class="calibre" />

<div id="calibre_link-1851" class="class9">Day 315: On the Cost of Education and Ignorance</div>
<div class="class20">If you think education is expensive &mdash; try ignorance.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Ann Landers</span>
<span id="calibre_link-801"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-782" class="class23">316</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">One of the worst excuses you can use to rationalize that you can’t educate yourself is to say that you don’t have the money needed to do so.</div>
<div class="class14">For one, ignorance is more expensive than education. One valuable piece of advice from a book can recoup its price a thousand times or more, while committing one big mistake (that educating yourself might have prevented) can lead to devastating losses.</div>
<div class="class14">A person who has never taken the time to learn how to eat healthily &mdash; something a $15 book can rectify &mdash; can ultimately pay for it with their life, while a person new to fitness may pay for their ignorance with a painful injury &mdash; something they could have prevented by watching a few free videos on proper form.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, in today’s world, education is available freely to anyone who has access to the Internet. While a private teacher can help you immensely, you can also learn a lot (on your own) from free videos, tutorials, articles, and books.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I taught myself how to write (I’ve never taken any formal courses, yet I’m now a bestselling author), how to create and modify websites (I’m not a programmer, yet I can design a <span id="calibre_link-1852"></span>
professional website, using available resources), or how to promote my books (even though I don’t have a degree in marketing).</div>
<div class="class14">It’s important to escape the paradigm of “education equals a college degree.” You aren’t educated merely because a piece of a paper says so. In fact, it’s often the opposite. Many students treat college as an extension of their childhood instead of an opportunity to learn and gain experience. Meanwhile, those who skip going to college often gain valuable, real-world experience that they can build upon.</div>
<div class="class14">When hiring contractors to help me in my business, I never look at their formal education. All I care about is their reviews, portfolio, and proposal specifying how they can help me. It’s what they can specifically do for me that counts, not mere words that may or may not confirm that they’re educated.</div>
<div class="class14">If you aren’t sure where to find high-quality education online for free or for a low price, check out Udemy, Coursera, Khan Academy, Stanford Online, Harvard Extension, Open Yale Courses, Codecademy, or simply look for the topic that interests you on YouTube, Amazon or in the iTunes store.</div>

<div class="class14">If at first you don’t fall in love with the process necessary to make your dream come true, don’t despair. As long as you don’t hate it, everything is fine. The love for the process comes along with consistent improvements. It’s impossible, or at least unlikely, to eventually not fall in love with what you’re becoming good at.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, many entrepreneurs think that they need to do what they love in order for their business to succeed. In reality, what matters most is that their business fulfills a certain need or solves a certain problem.</div>
<div class="class14">If I hire your company to clean my house, I don’t care if you’re passionate about it. All I care about is whether you can do it well, on time, and for a reasonable price. Initially, you might not <span class="class11">love</span>
 being in the cleaning business, but if your business starts doing well and you become good at running it, you’ll probably enjoy doing it &mdash; and thanks to that, it will get even easier to grow it.</div>
<div class="class14">The same applies to any other goal. Get started, make sure that you feel at least neutral about it, and be patient, because once you <span id="calibre_link-1854"></span>
start getting better at it, the process will become addictive and you won’t want to stop.</div>

<div class="class14">It might be a trite reminder, but it’s nonetheless frequently true: people often achieve impossible feats merely because they think they are able to do so. If you don’t think that you’re able, you either won’t try at all, or if you try, it will be a half-hearted attempt that is almost guaranteed to fail.</div>
<div class="class14">In rock climbing, I sometimes deliberately try routes or single moves well above my ability. I’ve found that sometimes the mere belief in your abilities can lead you to climbing a difficult route that, without such a belief, would result in a spectacular failure.</div>
<div class="class14">In business, the companies that grow the fastest are led by entrepreneurs who don’t set any limits for themselves. If they decide to sell their services to a Fortune 500 company, they’ll start figuring out how to <span class="class11">do</span>
 it instead of wasting time pondering whether they’re able to do so.</div>
<div class="class14">In sports, it’s often not the training in itself that makes an athlete successful. It’s what they tell themselves during the competition that makes the difference between winning or losing.</div>
<div class="class14">The next time you face a big, seemingly insurmountable challenge or find yourself in a situation with a low chance of emerging victoriously, assume that you’re able to overcome it &mdash; and then act as if it were true.

<div class="class14">If you want to remodel your house, you expect and accept the inconveniences it will cause.</div>
<div class="class14">There’s no way to replace the old windows, tiles, doors, or kitchen cabinets without making a mess. Repainting your bedroom means that you have to move furniture to another room. Giving your bathroom a makeover means that you’ll have to use a different bathroom or go to a friend’s house to take a shower.</div>
<div class="class14">You accept the disturbance that remodeling causes in your life because you want your house to be nice and cozy.

<div class="class20">One never knows a man till he has refused him something, and studied the effect of the refusal; one never knows himself till he has denied himself. The altar of sacrifice is the touchstone of character.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Orrin Philip Gilford</span>
<span id="calibre_link-937"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-919" class="class23">320</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Let’s be clear: denying yourself nice things is neither easy nor fun. However, in addition to the incredible benefits it brings in the form of increased self-control, it’s also a powerful test of your character and a self-discovery tool.</div>
<div class="class14">For one, self-refusal provides an opportunity to understand what you need in your life and what you only <span class="class11">think</span>
 you need in your life. Unless you stay away from what you consider your “necessities” for a period of time, you won’t know whether they’re really necessities, after all.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, on many of my adventures, I had to sleep in less than comfortable circumstances, such as in a car parked by the road or in a soaking wet tent with homeless dogs fighting outside.</div>
<div class="class14">I had always thought that I wouldn’t be able to recharge in such circumstances, but often I was actually more recharged after several hours of such uncomfortable sleep than in my own bed. What I considered a necessity was in fact a luxury. This realization made me a stronger person. I expanded my comfort zone and now I know I can handle sleeping in a wide variety of weird places<span id="calibre_link-1861"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, refusing yourself pleasant things can show you the depth of your addiction for them. For example, I used to eat a few pieces of dark chocolate daily. I assumed it wasn’t a big deal and I thought I could stop eating it whenever I wanted to. However, when I decided to take a break from eating all kinds of sweets, I felt immense cravings. Denying myself a few pieces of dark chocolate &mdash; an innocent pleasure &mdash; made me realize that I had been addicted to it.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, while we were young, it was our parents or other caretakers who told us we couldn’t get something. We fumed and protested, but there was nothing we could do about it. This way, unbeknownst to ourselves, we learned that we couldn’t always get everything we wanted &mdash; and I daresay it was one of the most powerful lessons in self-discipline a child could receive.</div>
<div class="class14">Today, as adults, most of us don’t have such gatekeepers. If you want to eat chocolate, you can go to the store and buy it; nobody will force you to eat broccoli instead. If you want to spend the entire Sunday in bed, nobody will kick you out of it and force you to go out and play with other kids.</div>
<div class="class14">This freedom feels good, but there’s also danger in it &mdash; by spoiling ourselves this way, we eventually do ourselves the same disservice as parents who spoil their children. Self-refusal, in essence, can act as an emergency brake, stopping us from spiraling into overindulgence.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Hesitation is normal when you face a big change in life. After all, you’re facing the unknown, and what’s unknown is scary. In the end, though, the longer you stare into the abyss, the more frightening it appears, and the more difficult it is to jump into it.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, it might be useful to think of a great change as being similar to taking a cold bath &mdash; the less time you give yourself to worry about how cold it might be, the more likely you are to actually jump into it.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, instead of wondering how tiring and uncomfortable it will be to go running, just put on your sports shoes and get out of the house. The more time you spend meditating on how unpleasant it might possibly be, the more likely it is that hesitation will kill any remnants of willpower you still have inside of you.</div>
<div class="class14">When decluttering your house, the same strategy can help you resist the temptation to keep things out of sentiment. Some old items are indeed so valuable that it might be worth it to keep them, but more often than not, people who tend to accumulate things use this rationalization for every piece of junk. Give yourself three seconds.&nbsp; <span id="calibre_link-1863"></span>
During those three seconds, if you can’t come up with any <span class="class11">powerful</span>
 memory that the item gives you, throw it away.</div>
<div class="class14">If you need to make a difficult phone call or have an uncomfortable conversation, hesitation will make it even scarier. By taking the plunge as quickly as possible, you’ll prevent your anxiety from growing and probably resolve the situation more effectively than if you were to wait.</div>

<div class="class20">We survive on too little sleep, wolf down fast foods on the run, fuel up with coffee and cool down with alcohol and sleeping pills. Faced with relentless demands at work, we become short-tempered and easily distracted. We return home from long days at work feeling exhausted and often experience our families not as a source of joy and renewal, but as one more demand in an already overburdened life.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-1032"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1019" class="class23">323</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">It makes me exhausted just to read this quote, let alone imagine that it’s possible to achieve any kind of positive results while living such a life.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re overburdened and feel like you have no control over your life, it’s time to change your life philosophy from the philosophy of <span class="class11">addition</span>
 to the philosophy of <span class="class11">subtraction</span>
. Let me explain…</div>
<div class="class14">The philosophy of addition is thinking that more is better. It means that you’re afraid to miss out on opportunities and that you say yes to everything, worried that saying no will make you unpopular or that you’ll appear selfish or lazy.</div>
<div class="class14">You constantly add and add, thinking that it’s through adding that your life gets better. Of course, in a certain way it does. The more you learn, the better you are. Generally speaking, the more money you have, the easier your life is.</div>
<div class="class14">However, this doesn’t apply to obligations and your calendar. The more tasks you have in your schedule and the more duties you <span id="calibre_link-1867"></span>
need to attend to, the more difficult it is to stop, reflect, and decide what deserves your attention and what doesn’t.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, I suggest adopting the philosophy of subtraction. You believe that less is more. You think twice before you accept any new responsibilities. You constantly seek to simplify your life and free up your calendar instead of stacking one task on top of another. You feel proud of having leisure time instead of feeling guilty about it.</div>
<div class="class14">As an exercise for today, think of just one regular task in your schedule that you could eliminate, in order to make your life less of a burden.</div>
<div class="class14">Perhaps you can hire a maid to save time spent keeping the house clean.</div>
<div class="class14">Maybe you already have enough money, but not enough time, and it would make sense to reduce the number of hours spent at work and accept the trade-off for the sake of your well-being.</div>
<div class="class14">Maybe you can move closer to your workplace, or the opposite: start working at home.</div>
<div class="class14">Perhaps it would be a good investment to use the services of a home meal delivery company and save the time spent on cooking and grocery shopping.</div>
<div class="class14">Subtract the unessential from your life to increase your focus on what is essential, but doesn’t get enough attention because of all the other, less-important obligations.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-1062"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1050" class="class23">324</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Research shows that even though there’s a dramatic reduction in energy expenditure when we sit, our appetites don’t drop down accordingly. This means that the more time you spend sitting, the more of a caloric surplus you create, and you gain weight more easily.</div>
<div class="class14">This poses a big problem for self-discipline because no amount of self-control will help you lose weight if you don’t expend much energy but your appetite behaves as if you did.</div>
<div class="class14">If you sit at work, consider standing up for at least a period of time when working. Stand-up desks are getting more and more popular, so it might be worth it to consider buying one or building it yourself. If it’s not possible to work standing up, at least get up every now and then and perform some quick exercises to offset some of the negative consequences of sitting.</div>
<div class="class14">At home, one of the biggest offenders is mindlessly watching TV. You can greatly reduce the amount of time spent sitting by eliminating cable TV and only watching specific movies or TV shows. Channel-hopping puts you in a zombie-like state, which, <span id="calibre_link-1869"></span>
when combined with snacking, can make it almost impossible to ever get in shape.</div>
<div class="class14">Think of sitting as a debt you need to repay. Fortunately, you can repay the debt not only with actual exercise, but also with little actions: standing up in the kitchen, performing household chores, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking a little bit farther away from the entrance to the supermarket.</div>
<div class="class14">Strive to move as much as you can, and you’ll reduce the negative impact prolonged sitting has on your well-being and increase your chances of successfully shedding that belly fat.</div>

<div class="class30">Larson’s words were as true during his era (he wrote those words in 1912) as they are now. If you’re ambitious &mdash; something that most people lack &mdash; you’re already considered a little weird by society’s standards.</div>
<div class="class14">People will try to persuade you to give up or take it easy because it’s a threat to their own egos. If you &mdash; a person just like them &mdash; manages to turn his or her dreams into reality, what does it say about their capabilities?</div>
<div class="class14">This invariably changes when you reach success. While you were down, few people stopped to lend a helping hand or offer you words of support. When you’re successful, suddenly everyone proclaims that they knew from the get-go that you would succeed.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re currently struggling and feeling down, make an effort to surround yourself with positive input as if you wanted to build a <span id="calibre_link-1871"></span>
protective bubble around yourself. Keep away from negative people who would love to finish you off with their nasty remarks. Get up, try again, and keep going until you get there.</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;George Eliot</span>
<span id="calibre_link-1144"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-1136" class="class23">327</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">You control what actions you take or don’t take, but in the long run, the actions that you take or don’t take also control <span class="class11">you</span>
 because they determine who you are.</div>
<div class="class14">As confusing as it sounds, there’s an important lesson hiding in there: when pondering what to do or not do, ask yourself what the person you’d like to become would or wouldn’t do. We define people by actions they take, so if you change the actions you take, you’ll also change your own definition of yourself.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, a person who runs often is a runner, while a person who constantly exposes themselves to danger for the fun of it is a daredevil. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a person who sits on the sofa the entire day is a slacker, while a person who never stands up for themselves is a doormat. The primary determinant of a runner, daredevil, slacker or doormat &mdash; rather than a specific adjective or trait &mdash; is what actions they take or don’t take.</div>
<div class="class14">Each action of yours, just like each thought or habit you have, has an impact on the direction your personal change is going to take. Think beyond the immediate consequences and consider each deed as a building block of the new you. What actions are congruent with the person you desire to become and what deeds aren’t<span id="calibre_link-1874"></span>
?</div>
<div class="class14">When thinking of the person you want to become in the future, along with setting new goals, make a list of actions the desired “future you” will engage in regularly and the actions that person will refuse to perform.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you want to become a more positive person, some of the actions you’ll engage in regularly include smiling, laughing, and expressing your gratitude, while some of the actions you’ll refuse to perform would be complaining, brooding, and criticizing.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1875" class="class9">Day 327: On the Biggest Person Standing in Your Way</div>
<div class="class20">You might occasionally feel that some people are standing in the way and slowing your progress, but in reality the biggest person standing in your way is you. Others can stop you temporarily &mdash; you are the only one who can do it permanently.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-141"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-140" class="class23">328</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">When others sabotage your efforts to implement a positive change in your life, it’s tempting to blame them for your lack of results. However, while they can affect your endeavors temporarily, in the end it’s only you who can torpedo your dreams.</div>
<div class="class14">For one, ultimately it’s you who makes a judgment of what the action of another person means to you and your goals. You can approach somebody’s effort to sabotage your dreams as an excuse to give up, or you can treat it as an obstacle that is an inherent part of the process. A “friend” who taunts you about your lack of results when dieting might discourage you, or they might boost your resolve to show them what you’re capable of.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, when other people try to limit your dreams, question your abilities, or tell you to stop having your head in the clouds, ultimately it’s not their belief that counts; it’s what you yourself think about the feasibility of your goals. Will you be bothered by people who doubt that you’ll ever build a successful business? Of course you will. Will they make you doubt that you’ll succeed? That <span id="calibre_link-1876"></span>
would happen only if you let them, by valuing <span class="class11">their</span>
 words more than your own belief in your abilities.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, when others are required to make your dreams come true and it seems as if they’re actively against you (say, a gatekeeper who won’t let you get through to the CEO of the company you’d like to sell your services to), yet again they are not the ones who can destroy your goal. It’s still up to you; you can come up with a different way to reach the CEO or develop a completely different approach to sell your service and grow your business.</div>
<div class="class14">Others can slow your progress, but it doesn’t mean that you’re powerless. When somebody stands in your way, jump over them, crawl underneath them, go around them, or punch them in the face (just kidding with the last one).</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Anger &mdash; or any other emotion that leads to impulsive decisions that you later regret &mdash; is an enemy of self-discipline. While it’s not always possible to catch yourself feeling angry before it converts into a full-blown attack of rage, whenever you can, act quickly and suppress the anger instead of feeding it. Anger that compounds on itself will quickly take away any remnants of self-control that you may have.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, when I’m stuck in a traffic jam, annoyed at other drivers or at the traffic lights seeming to take hours to change, I try to redirect my growing anger into another emotion, stop myself from cursing, or at least try to curse in a humorous way that won’t feed my frustration. That way, I prevent my anger from taking control of the situation. It’s a simple technique, but don’t let it fool you &mdash; it’s one of the most effective strategies to overcome attacks of unnecessary anger.</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to eliminate frequent attacks of anger from your life, begin counting the days on which you successfully suppress the first impulse to be angry. After a 7-day winning streak, you won’t want to lose all of your progress because of such a trivial thing as another driver driving too slowly or things temporarily not going your way<span id="calibre_link-1879"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">Will this strategy always work? Obviously not. Everyone gets angry from time to time. However, if you make a conscious effort not to feed your temper, you’ll reprogram your default behavior, greatly reduce the frequency of losing your temper, and gain better control over your emotional state.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">You won’t change until you recognize your bad beliefs and habits as your enemies. The best way to change them is to associate them with the pain that they’ve been steadily delivering to you ever since you first adopted them.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I overcame my habit of staying up late and waking up at 1-2 p.m. largely because of associating it with the depression I felt each winter because of a lack of sunlight.</div>
<div class="class14">Upon realizing that my habit and belief that I was a night owl had cost me so much and would bring me so much more pain in the future, I switched my routine. Today I can hardly think of a better feeling than getting up early and being super productive from beginning my day in the early morning.</div>
<div class="class14">What are your habits and beliefs costing you? You need to recognize all the different kinds of costs they have generated, are generating, and will continue to generate in the future if you don’t make some changes in your life. You will only be ready to change when you feel deep down in your gut how detrimental they are to you and your life.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">When you ask several people for their first thought about what “a lack of variety” means, you’ll probably get answers with negative connotations. To them, a lack of variety means boredom or being stuck in a rut. While routine can indeed be bad for you and your goals, it can also be a good thing.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, in dieting, eating the same meals over and over again (but changing them every several weeks or so when you get bored of them) simplifies the entire process. You no longer have to carefully calculate every macronutrient of a different food because you always eat the same things and can easily eyeball their caloric content.</div>
<div class="class14">In fitness, dedicating yourself to one sport or type of physical activity makes it easier to establish a habit of regular exercise. You don’t have to be watchful about how much you move every given week because you have workouts scheduled on the same days, lasting the same amount of time, each probably with the same intensity.</div>
<div class="class14">In managing your productivity, waking up and going to sleep at the same time ensures that the structure of your day is always the same, which allows you to maximize your productivity and reduce the amount of time spent figuring out when to attend to each task<span id="calibre_link-1887"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">There can be more freedom in a lack of variety than in living your life without such a restriction. For a period of time (say, a week), test this approach by limiting your choices and letting your routine make your decisions for you.</div>

y</div>
<div class="class20">It is our duty to be happy.</div>
<div class="class26">Why? Because our moods and happiness or unhappiness are catching. They inevitably infect other people. When we are happy we make other people happy, especially the people closest to us, physically, at home, at work, socially; and even people we speak to on the phone, online, or by email.</div>
<div class="class26">And, vitally important, there is the multiplier effect. I am happy, I make you happier, you make them happier, they make yet other people &mdash; whom you may never know &mdash; happier. The effect is incalculable, and it is always large.&nbsp;The same is true in reverse when you are miserable.</div>
<div class="class26">So time spent being miserable is antisocial. Stop it now! Relax, change your mood, be happy, and make the world hum rather than shudder.</div>
<div class="class21">

<span id="calibre_link-692"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-669" class="class23">334</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Just like you need self-discipline to become fitter, save money, learn a foreign language, or keep your house clean, so you need it to become and remain happy.</div>
<div class="class14">As we’ve already discussed, in some ways, being a negative person is being a lazy person. It takes more work to think positive thoughts, so we choose to feel unhappy because it’s an easier state to access; we could just as well invest some energy and feel good.</div>
<div class="class14">Whether you’re happy or not wouldn’t mean much for your goals if it weren’t for the fact that a positive attitude is one of the keys to accomplishment. It makes you believe that you can achieve <span id="calibre_link-1890"></span>
the impossible, boosts your courage, and keeps you going when you’re hit with one difficulty after another.</div>
<div class="class14">Consequently, you need to work on happiness, just like on any other important aspect of a self-disciplined life. If you find it challenging to put yourself in a good mood, think of happiness as a moral duty. You owe it to your loved ones and strangers to be happy because your mood &mdash; to a smaller or a larger extent &mdash; will infect them.</div>
<div class="class14">When you have the flu, you don’t deliberately go to crowded places or sneeze near your loved ones; you try your best not to infect them. Why would happiness be any different? Exert some self-discipline to think happy thoughts and eradicate the bad mood. It’s within your control to feel great or miserable.</div>
<div class="class14">Strive to infect others with happiness, not sadness. A great side effect is that the happier you make other people, the easier it will be to remain happy yourself.</div>

<div class="class14">Berating yourself for your failures simply doesn’t work. Instead of motivating you to do better next time, it only brings you down, causing you to be even less likely to exert your willpower. In fact, being too harsh towards yourself can turn one slip-up into a full-blown crisis or even into giving up on your goals because you become convinced that you’re too weak to change your life.</div>
<div class="class14">Instead of self-criticism, give yourself self-compassion. Whenever you fail to meet your standards, remind yourself that you were probably doing your best, but this time it simply didn’t work. Human beings aren’t perfect, so don’t assume that you’ll have 100% adherence to a diet, a workout program, or any other resolution you have.</div>
<div class="class14">Then, instead of looking for reasons why you suck because you failed, look for lessons in your slip-up and vow to do better next time, being careful to not repeat the same mistakes. Being kind to yourself will ultimately motivate you more to try again than poisoning yourself with your critical voice ever could.</div>

<div class="class20">“I don’t” is experienced as a choice, so it feels empowering. It’s an affirmation of your determination and willpower. “I can’t” isn’t a choice &mdash; it’s a restriction, it’s being imposed upon you. So thinking “I can’t” undermines your sense of power and personal agency.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">Be careful not to say “I can’t” whenever you’re working on implementing a new positive change in your life that requires you to give up something (such as going on a diet).</div>
<div class="class14">Thinking of your decision in terms of a restriction (“I <span class="class11">can’t</span>
 do it”) inevitably leads to discontent and approaching your change as a short-term solution. Admitting that a change is your <span class="class11">choice</span>
 by saying “I <span class="class11">don’t</span>
 do it” lends itself to treating it as a permanent identity shift.</div>
<div class="class14">A related technique you can use to give up something that’s bad for you is to associate it with the discomfort it leads to and deciding that you no longer want to suffer from it. You aren’t saying that you <span class="class11">can’t</span>
 do this thing any longer and thereby think of it as a restriction. You’re saying that you <span class="class11">don’t</span>
 do this thing because it’s your own choice, dictated by your wish to avoid the unpleasant consequences.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I was once a big lover of potatoes and they greatly contributed to me being overweight. When testing how certain foods affected me, I realized that potatoes made me bloated, tired, and led <span id="calibre_link-1898"></span>
to digestive issues. Just like that, I stopped eating potatoes that I had been previously eating in copious amounts at least three times a week. I’m sure that if it weren’t for uncovering my food intolerance and a conscious decision not to eat potatoes anymore, I would still be eating them. A restriction in the form of “I can’t eat potatoes” wouldn’t work.</div>
<div class="class14">Catch yourself whenever you say “I can’t” and replace it with “I don’t” or “I choose not to do it.” It’s a small change in your vocabulary, but the way you think about your changes can impact whether they become permanent or are only short-lived.</div>

<div class="class14">If you have a car, you probably regularly take it to the carwash. You drive it carefully in order not to scratch it or ding it. You respect it and appreciate it because it’s <span class="class11">your</span>
 vehicle.</div>
<div class="class14">Sadly, while most people take great pains to keep their cars pristine, they don’t think about their bodies in the same way. They fail to notice that while a car is replaceable, their body is the only body they’re ever going to get.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re constantly failing to introduce healthy habits, think of it as an expression of respect toward your body. I know, it sounds cheesy, but ultimately many people fail to care for their bodies because they never adopt a good, empowering metaphor to help them in their efforts.</div>
<div class="class14">Make exercise primarily about self-respect and appreciation for your body, and not an obsession to build a perfect body (which often leads to so much pressure that people completely give up). It doesn’t matter if you’re obese, if you can’t run for more than a minute, or if you can’t perform a single push-up. What matters right here and <span id="calibre_link-1900"></span>
right now is to learn to start caring for your body in the same way as you care for your other prized possessions.</div>
<div class="class14">Once healthy living becomes a habit (just like taking your car to the carwash or cleaning your house), then you can set more specific fitness goals to further strengthen your body.

<div class="class14">Merely reading a book from cover to cover, closing it, and immediately finding another book to learn from might work as entertainment when reading fiction. However, it doesn’t work with non-fiction. In order to learn, you need to exert a bit more self-discipline and read the book, along with noticing and remembering its key points. You can highlight important parts, make notes, or write short summaries.</div>
<div class="class14">What might be an even better idea than highlighting, making notes, or writing summaries is to make a bullet-point list of its practical applications in your life.

<div class="class20">I’ve found that it’s a good rule to never make an important decision when your emotions are in control. I try to program myself in advance to remember this rule when I need it. When I’m in an emotional state (either positive or negative), I try to keep just enough intellect working to tell me one thing: don’t decide now. I wait until I’ve relaxed and can think more clearly.</div>

</div>
<div class="class14">If you want to greatly increase the chances of making a bad decision, make it when you’re “under the influence” of strong emotions (either negative or positive). The same is true in reverse: to make a <span class="class11">good</span>
 decision, only do so when you’re in a neutral emotional state, relaxed enough to think clearly and weigh all the pros and cons.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I have a rule to never agree to make any big purchases over the phone or in person without giving myself at least a day to think it over. That way, I can think objectively about whether I really need to make such a purchase, and if so, research whether I was given a good offer.</div>
<div class="class14">Establish a similar rule in your life and always wait before making any big decisions. This also applies to setting big new goals. It’s better to set them when you’re in a neutral state of mind than when you’re pumped up, because if you do so while being <span id="calibre_link-1904"></span>
influenced by a temporary strong rush of endorphins, you’ll probably overestimate your abilities and set goals that are beyond your reach.</div>

<div id="calibre_link-1905" class="class9">Day 342: On Doing the Best You Can With What You Have</div>
<div class="class20">Success means doing the best we can with what we have. Success is the doing, not the getting &mdash; in the trying, not the triumph. Success is a personal standard &mdash; reaching for the highest that is in us &mdash; becoming all that we can be. If we do our best, we are a success. Success is the maximum utilization of the ability that you have.</div>
<div class="class24">&mdash;Zig Ziglar</div>
<div class="class14">One of the best ways to destroy your resolve is to associate success with results alone. If you fail to generate any results for a long time (as is often the case when working on difficult, long-term goals), the belief that you’re only doing well if you’re getting immediate results will discourage you from continuing.</div>
<div class="class14">The proper approach is to espouse the belief that success means doing the best you can with what you have. Regardless of the outcome, as long as you’re doing your best, you’re keeping yourself to the highest standard and that’s what matters the most. The results might come today, tomorrow, six months from now, or even a decade later.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, it’s not like you’re pursuing your goals for the sake of pursuing them &mdash; you want to get something for your efforts. However, it will be hard to make your dreams come true if you only obsess about the end result and forget to focus on the current <span id="calibre_link-1906"></span>
process. After all, ultimately it’s the journey itself that will shape you to become the person deserving the goal you’re after.</div>
<div class="class14">A successful businessman isn’t successful because he runs a successful business. He’s successful because he stuck to his business, despite difficulties, failures, and the seemingly hopeless situations in which he found himself. He wouldn’t have built a successful business if he had only defined himself by the results (which are rarely anything to brag about anyway, at least in the first several years of running a business).</div>
<div class="class14">A successful athlete isn’t successful because she has received a medal. She’s successful because she’s been training harder than her competitors and kept going despite pain, exhaustion, and discomfort. She would have failed to become a successful athlete if she had obsessed solely about the prizes, and not on the act of bettering her performance.</div>
<div class="class14">Embrace success as holding yourself to a high personal standard and focus on the process of consistently becoming better. As long as you do your best with what you have, the results will show up eventually.</div>

<div class="class14">The more vague your plans are, the more likely they are to remain in the realm of intentions instead of real-world actions. You need to make your plans specific, quantifiable, and (ideally) repeatable in some way so that each day brings you closer to accomplishing your goals.</div>
<div class="class14">“I’m going to write a book” is a good start, but it isn’t going to lead to any accomplishments unless you make it more specific by listing the specific actions that you’re going to take, such as: “Plot my story in 2000 words,” “Write the first chapter,” and later on, as the sole daily action that is required to reach your goal, “Write 1000 words every day.”</div>
<div class="class14">With goals that make it difficult to tell whether or when you’ve accomplished them, such as Arnold’s “I’m going to learn better English,” it’s crucial to set specific, quantifiable sub-goals, such as “<span id="calibre_link-1908"></span>
Master 100 common words related to medicine” or “Read ten history books in English,” so that you can objectively say that because of the effort you’ve exerted, you’ve indeed improved your abilities and have evidence that supports that view.</div>
<div class="class14">Note that the real work doesn’t begin until you take the first action designed to get you closer to your goals. Even the most specific and well-designed goal is still a dream until you figure out what concrete actions you need to take &mdash; and then take them &mdash; to convert it into a true goal with chances for success.</div>

<div class="class14">When setting any new goals, the desire for safety will fight against the desire for growth. Choosing safety is choosing instant gratification, while going for growth might be uncomfortable now, but will eventually deliver bigger and better rewards.</div>
<div class="class14">Learn how to overcome the desire for safety by regularly expanding your comfort zone and reaping the rewards of doing so. It’s hard to imagine how beneficial temporarily giving up safety can be unless you actually do it. No words of mine will persuade you more than you actually venturing out, testing it for yourself, and feeling more powerful, thanks to facing your fears.</div>
<div class="class14">You can also follow the strategy of alternating between periods of safety and growth: after each big step forward that required courage and put you in an uncomfortable situation, give yourself a few days to enjoy safety. Then, when you feel secure and recharged, expose yourself to danger and growth again. That way, you’ll consistently stretch yourself in a sustainable way, without ever completely exhausting your mental energy.</div>
<div class="class14">That’s what I often do during my rock climbing workouts: on some workouts I favor technical routes that require little courage but <span id="calibre_link-1910"></span>
lots of focus and then on other workouts, I climb difficult, mental routes where a fear of falling enters into the equation.</div>
<div class="class14">Thanks to this approach, I rarely don’t feel like climbing; whenever I don’t feel mentally ready to give up the feeling of security, I can simply do something else and then expand my comfort zone the next time, when I’ll have recovered.</div>
<div class="class14">Stretch your comfort zone frequently, but do it in a sustainable way: ensure that you regularly get to enjoy at least a short period of security to gather energy for another expedition that will take you beyond your comfort zone.</div>

<div class="class14">For example, if you’re on a diet, there’s no rule stating that you can’t cook exotic healthy meals or try foods you’ve never tasted before. Starting a diet can be a good opportunity to introduce more variety in your nutritional habits.</div>

<div class="class14">One interesting and empowering way to look at failure is to consider it a sign that you’re trying to surpass yourself.

Hence, if you aren’t failing, you’re probably not stretching yourself enough.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’ve been going a long time without any failures, it’s time to think bigger. Not experiencing any failures is a clear sign that you’re setting your aims too low and it’s time to seek a more challenging environment or establish new, more difficult goals.</div>
<div class="class14">Success is obviously a positive thing, but bear in mind that if you’re constantly succeeding, it comes with the risk of getting too cocky and assuming that you’re invincible. Setting goals with a high risk of failure will help you stay humble and ultimately aid you in keeping success in your life.</div>

Find out just what any people will quietly submit to, and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.

<div class="class14">Likewise, the limits of problems in your life are determined by your tolerance of them. If you have a slight pain in your little toe, you probably aren’t going to go see the doctor, but multiply the pain by a factor of five and you’ll be at the doctor’s office in a split second!</div>
<div class="class14">Think in the same way about your bad habits or any other harmful actions of yours. If the perceived pain (negative consequences) is weak, you’ll most likely continue to tolerate it for as long as it doesn’t increase. Intensify the pain, and you’ll start looking for solutions.</div>
<div class="class14">There are two ways to inspire you to give up negative behaviors:</div>
<div class="class14">1. The pain caused by your negative behaviors intensifies by itself. One day you realize that the problem has grown to such proportions that you <span class="class11">must</span>
 do something about it. For example, your negative nutritional habits lead to a heart attack or failing to improve your self-confidence makes you a loner without any friends<span id="calibre_link-1915"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">This is <span class="class11">not</span>
 a good way to deal with negative behaviors, because you’re letting the problem grow uncontrollably until it poses a big risk in your life.</div>
<div class="class14">2. Intensifying the pain by making yourself aware of how deep the pain goes. Instead of ignoring the pain and keeping it running in the background, you tune in to it and focus on all of its consequences. Make them bigger and assume they will get soon get worse. Use the negative visualization to inspire the change.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, once you notice you’re gasping for air after climbing a set of stairs, assume that it’s the first sign of an incoming rapid deterioration of health. New symptoms will soon follow, and each will be stronger than the previous one. The slight discomfort you have now is only the beginning. Amplify its message and act now while you still can. Don’t ignore it by thinking that you can forget about it for now and you will address it later if it gets worse.</div>
<div class="class14">Unless you can convince yourself how far-reaching and dangerous the consequences of your behaviors can be in the long term, you won’t act. Think of any negative behaviors of yours as tyrants: to what extreme measures must they go before you stop enduring their oppression?</div>

<div class="class14">You can have all the time in the world, but if you don’t have energy, it won’t mean anything. Your energy is your primary resource needed to change your life for the better; if you lack it, your chances of attaining your goals drop to zero.</div>
<div class="class14">For this reason, it’s vital to learn how to manage your energy. That’s why I’m so adamant about the importance of healthy habits like getting enough sleep, eating healthily, and exercising regularly. If you don’t have such habits, your energy levels are compromised and you’re less likely to achieve your goals.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition to healthy habits, consider making a list of things, places, and people who energize you and a second list of those that rob you of energy. Now that you have both lists in front of you, think about how you can restructure your life to spend as much time as possible in an energizing environment with energizing people, and as little time as possible in situations that rob your energy.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, large crowds exhaust me, so you’ll almost never find me in one. On the other end of the spectrum, spending time in nature recharges me, so I strive to be outdoors at least a few times a week.</div>
<div class="class14">Energy management is one of the key skills you need to perform well in both your professional and personal life. Let me assure you <span id="calibre_link-1919"></span>
that no matter how disciplined you are, if you routinely exhaust yourself, one day you’ll burn out. Wouldn’t it be better to learn how to manage your energy today, so that you can avoid this unpleasant problem altogether?</div>

<div class="class14">We’ve discussed that it’s essential to replace “I can’t do it” with “I don’t do it” in order not to think of your resolutions as punishments. This entry is about taking that even further: instead of asking yourself what you have to give up, think of something more important that you want to gain. In other words, frame your perception of giving up a harmful behavior as an act of empowerment, not an act of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you want to start saving money, it’s not a question of what you won’t be able to buy anymore. The right question is what will saving more money let you “go big on”? How about improving your peace of mind, spending less time shopping, treating your family to a nice vacation, or (ultimately) perhaps even retiring early? In the grand scheme of things, what does giving up some purchases mean in comparison to <span class="class11">that</span>

<a href="#calibre_link-646" class="class23">354</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">On several occasions, we have talked about cultivating positive emotions when things go bad. I argued that focusing on the bad things is an act of mental laziness because they’re easier to access than the positive ones. Today I’d like to talk about this topic yet again, this time by looking at it as a new habit to instill.</div>
<div class="class14">As people get older, they tend to focus more on the dark side of things. Perhaps it’s because they’ve experienced more things, suffered more failures, or were let down by more people. Whatever the reason, if you want to remain a happy and successful person, grumbling is not the way to go.</div>
<div class="class14">If by default you focus on the dark side, it’s time to develop a new habit: whenever you catch yourself focusing on the dark side of things, come up with one good thing about the situation and focus on that thought instead. Keep your mouth shut if you want to voice a complaint.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re out enjoying a walk with a friend and it’s starting to rain, resist the temptation to complain about the bad weather. Instead, say (for example) that it’s nice to take a walk despite the rain because there are fewer people around, or redirect <span id="calibre_link-1927"></span>
your attention to something else, such as your friend’s recent success.</div>
<div class="class14">Exhibiting a positive attitude takes work, but it’s work that is well worth the effort. Strive to focus on the positive and train yourself to always find something good, even in the worst circumstances. You’ll get better at controlling your thoughts and become more optimistic and resilient.</div>

<div class="class14">The more luxuries you consume and surround yourself with, the more you’ll become accustomed to them &mdash; and the harder it will be for you to tolerate something less than perfect.</div>
<div class="class14">While there’s nothing wrong in enjoying the fruits of your labor and making your life a little bit more convenient, be cautious to not overindulge in luxuries. They can spoil you and make you less resilient and capable of dealing with difficult situations.</div>
<div class="class14">Not being able to accept something less than perfect is ultimately a big weakness.

<span class="class32">e</span>
</div>
<div class="class20">I’ve trained myself to propose solutions instead of ask for them, to elicit responses instead of react, and to be assertive without burning bridges. To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop the uncommon habit of making decisions, both for yourself and for others.</div>

<span class="class22">&mdash;Tim Ferriss</span>
<span id="calibre_link-725"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-724" class="class23">356</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">You need a lot of self-discipline to take the initiative instead of taking the easy way out and waiting for somebody else to act. It’s easier to present a problem and ask for solutions than to suggest some yourself. It’s easier to delegate the responsibility for the decision to someone else, essentially freeing yourself of the discomfort of having to make a decision in exchange for losing control over the situation.</div>
<div class="class14">To obtain better results in all kinds of endeavors, become the person who takes the initiative.</div>
<div class="class14">If you’re dealing with a problem that affects others, instead of only <span class="class11">presenting</span>
 the problem to the group, propose several solutions. Resist the temptation to be lazy by relying on others’ ideas and come up with your own.</div>
<div class="class14">I used to work with a few business partners and I can tell you that there’s nothing better than an associate who doesn’t merely wait for the solutions, but offers them himself or herself. And the reverse is also true: there’s nothing worse than a collaborator who only brings you problems and expects you to solve them all<span id="calibre_link-1932"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">In addition, become proactive and react as quickly as you can. Yes, it’s uncomfortable to stand out and take the initiative while everybody else is looking at you and judging you. However, ultimately, he or she who acts first is the leader; immediately reacting to situations also trains you to overcome hesitation and to develop a habit of taking action.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, if you’re walking down the street and somebody looks like they’re about to faint, overcome your social fears and ask them if they’re fine. Such a small decision of yours might mean the difference between life and death for that stranger.</div>
<div class="class14">I was once on a bike ride with a friend when we noticed a man lying down in the middle of the sidewalk, blood dripping out of his ear. Nobody stopped to help him, and yet he was a stone’s throw away from a church packed with people.</div>
<div class="class14">Who knows? Maybe nobody offered to help because they were afraid to take action or thought that somebody else would take the initiative. Fortunately, we attended to the man and the ambulance arrived quickly to take him to the hospital. What if nobody had stopped to help him for several hours?</div>
<div class="class14">Taking the initiative is often uncomfortable, but that’s just one more reason to do it. Don’t <span class="class11">react</span>
 &mdash; act. Don’t present <span class="class11">problems</span>

<div class="class14">For this reason, one of the most powerful exercises you can do to improve your chances of acting differently from others when you know that you’re right is to practice holding your ground. If somebody tells you to do something in a given way but you don’t understand why, ask them to explain their request. If the explanation isn’t sufficient, suggest a different way of doing things that you think might be better.</div>
<div class="class14">Note that this isn’t about confrontation for the sake of confrontation. It’s an exercise in questioning doing things in a given <span id="calibre_link-1936"></span>
way just because “that’s how they’ve been done until now,” but nobody knows why.</div>

When we give ourselves treats, we feel energized, cared for, and contented, which in turn boosts self-command. When we don’t get any treats, we feel depleted, resentful, and angry, and we feel justified in self-indulgence. We start to crave comfort &mdash; and grab that comfort wherever we can, even if it means breaking good habits.</div>

I don’t know of a single person, no matter how self-disciplined, who doesn’t treat themselves to a small pleasure or indulgence every now and then and who doesn’t use rewards as a motivational tool. Treats and rewards serve an important role: they help you to recover and to face future discomforts with a more positive outlook.</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t make the mistake of assuming that you’re so disciplined that you don’t need rewards or treats in order to work on your goals. There’s only one outcome from making such a dangerous assumption: after a period of doing well, you’ll start craving comfort. Since you’ll deny yourself the needed comfort, the desire to indulge will build up, eventually explode, and destroy any remnants of self-discipline that remained<span id="calibre_link-1939"></span>

<div class="class14">Set rewards for accomplishments and don’t be afraid to indulge in small pleasures from time to time &mdash; as long as they’re small and don’t compromise your long-term goals. Self-care reinforces self-command, while self-denial depletes it.</div>

This method can be performed with a foam roller, lacrosse ball, Theracane, or your own hands. By applying pressure to specific points on your body you are able to aid in the recovery of muscles and assist in returning them to normal function. Normal function means your muscles are elastic, healthy, and ready to perform at a moment’s notice.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-867"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-866" class="class23">360</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">As the quote explains, self-myofascial release is a term for self-massage. You focus on trigger points in your body to release tension and bring back the previous elasticity of your muscles.</div>
<div class="class14">What does it have to do with self-discipline? Here are three ways that it applies:.</div>
<div class="class14">First, it’s difficult to be on top of your game if your body is constantly tense. I find it hard to focus on work if I suffer from back pain. When I spend a few minutes massaging the tightest spots, the mental tension goes away along with the physical tension.</div>
<div class="class14">Second, one common reason why people skip workouts or avoid putting themselves in uncomfortable situations is because they’re in pain. A lot of that pain comes from your body being tight like a bowstring. Several weeks spent addressing your most painful trigger points can work miracles when it comes to eliminating chronic pain.</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, self-myofascial release (such as using a foam roller) isn’t a particularly comfortable thing to do. In fact, it can be <span id="calibre_link-1942"></span>
immensely painful. And that’s precisely why self-massage can be a valuable exercise for your self-discipline.</div>
<div class="class14">Just like in any other exercise, you suffer some temporary pain or discomfort but eventually get a bigger reward. With self-massage, you experience the temporary pain of applying pressure to your trigger points, but then benefit from increased mobility and free yourself from the chronic pain of tight muscles.</div>
<div class="class14">Buying an inexpensive lacrosse ball or a foam roller can be one of your best investments. Greatly reduced (or even eliminated) pain, increased mobility, and improved self-discipline are more than worth the twenty or thirty bucks spent on a self-massage tool.</div>

<div class="class20">If in our daily life we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but everyone will profit from it. If we really know how to live, what better way to start the day than with a smile? Our smile affirms our awareness and determination to live in peace and joy. The source of a true smile is an awakened mind.</div>

<span id="calibre_link-904"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-903" class="class23">361</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">Smiling is one of the easiest, and one of the hardest things to do. It’s natural to smile when you’re happy and feel good, and almost impossible when you’re in pain or feeling unwell.</div>
<div class="class14">With increased self-control, your ability to do things in spite of what you <span class="class11">feel</span>
 like doing increases. Smiling can be an excellent exercise in this practice.</div>
<div class="class14">I don’t want to downplay the negative things that may be happening in your or anyone else’s life. However, the truth is that we often resort to scowling, crying, worrying, and radiating negativity when we experience negative emotions, just because this state is easier to access than the positive one.</div>
<div class="class14">When you think about it logically, it makes no sense to further ruin your mood after experiencing something negative. If you have a cold, you don’t go out naked in the middle of the winter to catch pneumonia, too. Yet, that’s pretty much what we’re doing anytime we decide to humor negative emotions instead of smiling despite them, or at least trying to lift our spirits a little.</div>
<div class="class14">Obviously, it’s easy to say that. Some negative events are such that they can destroy a person from the inside out, and telling them <span id="calibre_link-1945"></span>
to smile would be ridiculous. Apply this advice primarily to the small everyday struggles you encounter, where your negative reaction isn’t necessary.</div>
<div class="class14">For the next week, try to handle every difficulty with a smile on your face. It doesn’t matter if your smile isn’t entirely genuine. The point is to make an effort in overcoming your default reaction of feeling negative and replace it with a more positive attitude.</div>
<div class="class14">Even if you fail to maintain a better mood for more than a couple of minutes, the exercise in itself will help you better control your impulses and might even lift your spirits slightly. And if you repeat it often enough, your brain’s pathways will change and make you more capable of feeling positive, even when bad things happen &mdash; and that’s not a bad ability to have, is it?</div>

<div class="class14">Inspiration is important to get you to start working on your goals, but you can’t rely on it alone if you want to pursue excellence and become a high performer. The keys to professionalism are:</div>
<div class="class14">
<span class="class28">1. Routine.</span>
 Don’t wait for inspiration to strike you. In an ideal world you’d be inspired all the time, always pumped up to work. In the real world, you’re probably going to be uninspired more often than you’ll be inspired. Yet, if you want to become professional, you need to deliver on both good and bad days.</div>
<div class="class14">Establish a routine of what you need to produce each day (whether it’s 1000 words of a book, playing the guitar for an hour, making 50 sales calls, or learning 20 new words in a foreign language) and stick to it, regardless of your mood.</div>
<div class="class14">
<span class="class28">2. Reliability.</span>
 If you give a promise, you fulfill it &mdash; and that includes any promise you make to yourself. This also means sticking to deadlines and resisting the temptation to extend them just because they’re difficult to meet.</div>
<div class="class14">
<span class="class28">3. Constant improvement.</span>
 Amateurs dabble, while professionals constantly improve their craft. Always seek new ways to improve your performance and avoid the laziness of rejecting <span id="calibre_link-1948"></span>
new, possibly better methods, just because they can disrupt your current way of doing things.<br class="calibre" />

<div id="calibre_link-1949" class="class9">Day 363: On Relying Upon <span id="calibre_link-1950" class="calibre2"></span>
Yourself</div>
<div class="class20">It always makes more sense to concentrate on the direct alternatives &mdash; the things you do control. What others do is up to them, but there’s always a great deal you can do. Choose from the alternatives that require only your decision &mdash; not from among the many hopes that someone will be something other than what he is. To rely on your rights or on your ability to change others is far less promising than to rely upon yourself.</div>
<div class="class21">
<span class="class22">&mdash;Harry Browne</span>
<span id="calibre_link-972"></span>
<a href="#calibre_link-971" class="class23">363</a>
</div>
<div class="class14">One dangerous pitfall to be aware of when setting goals is to avoid tying them to the performance or willingness of other people.</div>
<div class="class14">For example, I believe that the best business partner is yourself and nobody else. If you have a goal to build a successful business so you can eventually dedicate yourself to your children and your business partner doesn’t have such a strong motivation, it will be a source of conflict forever. You’ll need his or her approval for any business decision, and 50% of the success of your business will depend on the other person. Losing full control over the decision-making process means lowering your chances of success.</div>
<div class="class14">In exercise, you might feel tempted to wait before you buy a gym pass until you persuade your friend to start exercising with you. Yes, working out with a partner is more effective, but if you’re relying on this person to establish a positive change in your life, you’ve already failed. And what if your friend drops out? Will you drop out, too<span id="calibre_link-1951"></span>
?</div>
<div class="class14">Don’t wait for another person to change your life. You can hope that their desires will be in line with yours, but it’s a better strategy to rely on yourself by choosing alternatives that require your decision alone.</div>

o</div>
<div class="class20">Books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind.</div>

<div class="class14">On day 79 I shared with you three inspirational books and then, on day 158, I suggested some biographies to read. Today, now that we’re at the end of this book, I’d like give you some additional recommendations that you might find it valuable to read after you finish <span class="class11">365 Days With Self-Discipline</span>
. Here they are:</div>
<div class="class14">1. <span class="class11">Make It BIG! 49 Secrets for Building a Life of Extreme Success,</span>
 by Frank McKinney. Brilliantly inspiring and practical book written by a fascinating entrepreneur and philanthropist.</div>
<div class="class14">2 and 3. <span class="class11">Unlimited Power</span>
 and <span class="class11">Awaken the Giant Within,</span>
 by Tony Robbins. Two self-help classics that everyone should read.</div>
<div class="class14">4. <span class="class11">Essentialism,</span>
 by Greg McKeown. If you’re struggling to identify your priorities and focus on what matters most, this book will help you.</div>
<div class="class14">5. <span class="class11">The Obstacle Is the Way,</span>
 by Ryan Holiday. An excellent book, loosely based on the Roman philosophy of stoicism, that teaches you how to succeed in spite of hardships<span id="calibre_link-1954"></span>
.</div>
<div class="class14">6. <span class="class11">How Not to Die,</span>
 by Michael Greger. If you want to learn more about the why and how of healthy eating habits, this book is for you. Understanding on a deeper level how your unhealthy choices can affect your life can boost your resolve to finally make a change.<br class="calibre" />

<div class="class19">Day 365: On Sweeping the Floor</div>
<div class="class20">My friend the philosopher and martial artist Daniele Bolelli once gave me a helpful metaphor. He explained that training was like sweeping the floor. Just because we’ve done it once, doesn’t mean the floor is clean forever. Every day the dust comes back. Every day we must sweep.</div>

</div>
<div class="class30">As we’re about to part ways, I’d like you leave you with an important reminder: cultivating self-discipline, like training or sweeping the floor, is something that must be done daily.</div>
<div class="class14">As incredible as it would be to build self-discipline just once and then enjoy it for the rest of your life, it requires constant work to maintain it so that it can aid you in your objectives.</div>
<div class="class14">The moment you put instant gratification back on the pedestal is the moment you start losing your self-control.</div>
<div class="class14">The moment you decide that it’s time to embrace the easy life and stay away from the challenges is the moment your life starts getting harder.</div>
<div class="class14">The moment you decide that you’re already strong enough and nothing can break your spirit is the moment you start losing mental resilience.</div>
<div class="class14">We’ve spent 365 days together, but your journey toward self-discipline doesn’t end here. Grab the broomstick and start sweeping!</div>
</div>


<div id="calibre_link-628" class="calibre1">
<div id="calibre_link-1956" class="class9">Epilogue</div>
<div class="class10">Our journey has come to an end and I don’t want to keep you here for long. I hope that you’ve gathered so many different ideas to apply in your life that you’ll be busy implementing them for a long time to come!</div>
<div class="class14">As a quick final reminder, please remember that accumulating knowledge without applying it in real life is like reading cookbooks without ever actually following any of the recipes. What’s the point? Put on your chef’s uniform and get cooking; you have 365 different recipes to try!</div>
<div class="class14">Finally, please note that I wrote this book to give you inspiration and offer various tips that apply to different aspects of self-discipline. I prioritized brief, universal suggestions over detailed how-to advice.</div>
