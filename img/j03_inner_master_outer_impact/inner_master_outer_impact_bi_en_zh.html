<p class ="en"> O ne day, in the pre-internet age, I drove from my home in Palo Alto to Yosemite National Park upon the invitation of two friends who were camping there. This was going to be my first time at Yosemite. I had not seen any photos of the park, so I had no idea what to expect. It was dark by the time I reached its gates. I was greeted by park rangers and given a map. A long and winding road took me to the valley within. As I drove the final stretch, a blanket of peace fell over me. My spirit began to soar, and my thoughts became clearer. Nature—with its gurgling brooks, rustling leaves, and starlit sky—was casting a spell. I arrived at my friends’ campground in the pitch of darkness and was soon happily asleep, imagining we were in a lush meadow surrounded by hills. When I awoke and walked out of my tent at dawn the next morning, I was instantly awestruck. Towering, steep, barren rock formations shooting up toward the skies from everywhere, a waterfall roaring down from one of the mountains, the color green taking on a thousand hues, and vistas upon vistas—it was  nature at its rapturous best. I had no idea this was the paradise I had entered the night before and so casually slept in. The sheer splendor of Yosemite Valley was breathtaking, and the feelings of grandeur and beauty it evoked have never left me. I recall feeling like I was in the presence of something divine. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在前互联网时代，有 一天 ，我应两个在优胜美地国家公园露营的朋友的邀请，从我在帕洛阿尔托的家驱车前往那里。这将是我第一次到优胜美地。我没有见过公园的任何照片，所以我不知道该期待什么。当我到达公园大门的时候，天已经黑了。公园管理员接待了我，并给我一张地图。一条漫长而曲折的道路把我带到了里面的山谷。当我行驶到最后一段时，一片宁静笼罩着我。我的精神开始翱翔，我的思想变得更加清晰。大自然--它的潺潺溪流、沙沙的树叶和星光灿烂的天空--正在施展魔法。我在黑暗中到达我朋友的露营地，很快就愉快地睡着了，想象着我们是在一片被山丘环绕的茂盛草地上。第二天早上，当我醒来，走出帐篷时，我立刻被惊呆了。高耸、陡峭、荒芜的岩石构造从各处向天空射来，瀑布从其中一座山峰上咆哮而下，绿色呈现出千百种色彩，远处的景象层出不穷--这就是 ，大自然的狂欢之美。我不知道这就是我前一天晚上进入的天堂，并且如此随意地睡在里面。优胜美地山谷的纯粹壮丽令人叹为观止，它所唤起的宏伟和美丽的感觉从未离开过我。我记得我感觉自己是在一个神圣的地方。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> My search for a lifelong passion had already taken me down three paths—mathematics, management consulting, and entrepreneurship—by the time I joined the Columbia Business School faculty in 2004. It was now December 2005, and I was wrapping up my fall semester course on marketing strategy. I had developed a strong bond with my students, and recognizing that I might not see them again after the course ended, I felt a keen desire to impart to them the most valuable guidance I could. So before concluding my final lecture, I shared three personal stories and the lessons I’d learned from them. After class, a student, Min-Jun, came up to me and said,  “Professor, thank you for your time with us this semester. But most of all, thank you for your personal stories today. Those were for me the most valuable learnings from the course.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 当我在2004年加入哥伦比亚大学商学院的时候，我对终生激情的寻找已经带我走上了三条道路--数学、管理咨询和创业精神。现在是2005年12月，我正在结束秋季学期的营销战略课程。我与我的学生建立了深厚的感情，认识到课程结束后我可能不会再见到他们，我感到非常渴望向他们传授我所能提供的最宝贵的指导。因此，在结束我的最后一堂课之前，我分享了三个个人故事和我从中学到的教训。下课后，一位名叫Min-Jun的学生走过来对我说， "教授，感谢你这学期和我们在一起。但最重要的是，感谢你今天的个人故事。对我来说，这些是课程中最有价值的学习内容。" </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> I was happy, and dumbstruck. Through this parting comment, Min-Jun had confirmed what I’d long felt as a nagging suspicion—that there was a big hole in what we were teaching at business school. We were teaching how to grow a startup, a product, an investment, or a new business idea to its full potential. But we were not teaching how to grow your own self to your full potential. We were teaching how to direct others, change others, motivate others, influence others, and inspire others. But we were not teaching how to direct yourself, change yourself, motivate yourself, influence yourself, and inspire yourself. We were teaching how to lead everyone else, but not how to lead yourself. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 我很高兴，也很茫然。通过这句临别赠言，敏俊证实了我长期以来一直觉得耿耿于怀的猜想--我们在商学院所教的东西有一个很大的漏洞。我们教的是如何让一个初创企业、一个产品、一项投资或一个新的商业理念充分发挥其潜力。但我们并没有教如何使你自己的潜力得到充分发展。我们教的是如何指导他人，改变他人，激励他人，影响他人，并激励他人。但我们没有教如何指导自己、改变自己、激励自己、影响自己和激励自己。我们在教如何领导其他人，但没有教如何领导自己。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I was ten years old when I came across the story of the Indian emperor Ashoka. He ascended to the throne after killing his brothers. As king, he waged war upon bloody war to bring other kingdoms under his subjugation, building a vast empire that swept across the Indian subcontinent. But that is not why he is revered by the people of India. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我在10岁的时候看到了印度皇帝阿育王的故事。他在杀死自己的兄弟后登上了王位。作为国王，他发动了一场又一场的血腥战争，将其他王国置于他的征服之下，建立了一个横扫印度次大陆的庞大帝国。但这并不是他被印度人民所敬仰的原因。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> One day, Ashoka stepped on the battlefield to witness the ravages of war. As he saw the wounded and the dead, the wailing widows and  the orphans, his heart melted. He realized the folly of his ways and committed to never waging another war. He still planned to pursue success, but not the kind of success he had chased until that moment. He spent the rest of his life using his wealth to serve his people and propagate spiritual understanding throughout his kingdom. It is this reformed Ashoka—not the rapacious Ashoka—who reigns supreme in the hearts of Indians more than two thousand years after his death. He is commonly known as Ashoka the Great. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 有一天，阿育王踏上了战场，目睹了战争的蹂躏。当他看到受伤和死亡的人、哭泣的寡妇和 孤儿时，他的心融化了。他意识到自己的做法是愚蠢的，并承诺不再发动战争。他仍然计划追求成功，但不是他在那一刻之前所追逐的那种成功。他的余生都在用他的财富为他的人民服务，并在他的王国里宣传精神理解。正是这位经过改革的阿育王--而不是贪婪的阿育王--在他死后两千多年的印度人心中占据着至高无上的地位。他通常被称为阿育王大帝。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When I was a ten-year-old, my fascination with Ashoka stemmed from neither his former ferocity nor his latter nobility, but rather from his capacity to transform himself, in one short life, from one to the other. It made me wonder. Do I, too, possess seeds of remarkable transformation within myself? What is the greatest version of me that I could be? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 当我还是个十岁的孩子时，我对阿育王的迷恋既不是因为他以前的凶残，也不是因为他以后的高贵，而是因为他有能力在短短的一生中从一个人转变为另一个人。这让我想知道。我是否也在自己体内拥有显著转变的种子？我能够成为的最大版本是什么？ </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Ever since then, I have had a deep and abiding interest in exploring the highest achievements in human life, and the inner and outer steps we can take to get there. India, the country of my birth, provided fertile soil for such tilling. It was in this land that timeless truth-seekers forged the discipline of yoga, which cultivates the potential we all possess for perfection in action, thought, feeling, and spirit. It was in this land that a privileged prince renounced his luxuries and slipped out of his palace to embark on a lifelong quest for enlightenment, transforming himself into the Buddha. It was in this land that a remarkable lineage of ten spiritual teachers distilled the notion of an ideal life into the simple, devotional, and service-oriented faith of Sikhism. And it was in this same land where another great faith, Jainism, perfected nonviolence into a discipline that could be practiced not only with other humans, but with all living beings; not only in action, but also in speech, thought, and intention. India has from ancient times sought to map the contours of human potential, only to discover that there are no limits to it at all. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 从那时起，我就对探索人类生活中的最高成就，以及我们可以采取的内在和外在步骤产生了深刻而持久的兴趣。印度，我出生的国家，为这种耕作提供了肥沃的土壤。正是在这片土地上，永恒的真理探索者们打造了瑜伽学科，它培养了我们所有人在行动、思想、感觉和精神上完美的潜力。正是在这片土地上，一位享有特权的王子放弃了他的奢侈品，溜出了他的宫殿，开始了对启蒙的终生追求，把自己变成了佛陀。正是在这片土地上，一个由十位精神导师组成的杰出家族将理想生活的概念提炼成锡克教的简单、虔诚和以服务为导向的信仰。也正是在这片土地上，另一个伟大的信仰--耆那教，将非暴力完善为一种纪律，不仅可以对其他人类，而且可以对所有的生物进行实践；不仅在行动上，而且在言论、思想和意图上。印度自古以来一直在寻求绘制人类潜力的轮廓，结果发现根本没有任何限制。 </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> And whenever Indian civilization has encountered the prickly strands of foreign faiths, it has happily woven their finest threads into its own spiritual fabric. The Sufis, practitioners of a mystical branch of Islam, brought their intoxicating poetry and music to India,  illuminating the human heart’s capacity for a pure, universal, ever-expanding form of love, and fostering an even more mystical path by fusing their faith with India’s. Mahatma Gandhi’s epochal movement against British rule was as deeply influenced by Christ’s teachings of love and forgiveness and the American Transcendentalists’ teachings of civil disobedience as by the Hindu prophet Krishna’s teachings of nonattachment to the fruits of one’s labor. Perhaps it is this spiritual immersion that moved Martin Luther King Jr., on his sole visit to India, to say, “To other countries I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 每当印度文明遇到外国信仰的刺儿头时，它都会高兴地把它们最好的线编织到自己的精神结构中。苏菲派是伊斯兰教的一个神秘分支，他们把令人陶醉的诗歌和音乐带到了印度， ，照亮了人心对纯洁、普遍、不断扩大的爱的能力，并通过把他们的信仰与印度的信仰结合起来，促进了更加神秘的道路。圣雄甘地反对英国统治的划时代运动深受基督的爱与宽恕的教诲和美国超验主义者的公民不服从的教诲以及印度教先知克里希纳的不执着于自己的劳动成果的教诲的影响。也许正是这种精神上的沉浸感动了小马丁-路德-金，在他对印度的唯一一次访问中，他说："到其他国家我可以作为游客，但到印度我是作为朝圣者来的。" </p></div>

From childhood on, thanks to the retreats my family attended and the spiritual literature on my father’s bookshelf, I developed certain inner and outer routines of my own—an irregular meditation practice, late-night conversations with the universe, and a sampling of world scriptures, philosophies, and truth-seekers’ journeys—that made me keenly aware of a life beyond the material and the everyday. </p></div>
<div class="top right">

<p class ="en"> In high school, I dove avidly into the study of psychology to advance what I’d learned of human nature from faith and philosophy. I thought this might be the route to the transformation I was seeking. But I struggled to connect with the subject. At that time, in the 1980s, psychology was focused on the darkness within us and not the light—on schizophrenia, depression, and trauma, not genius, joy, and flourishing. So I gave up on my plan to major in psychology in college. I made the exploration of my highest potential a quiet, inner pursuit, while on the outside I got swept up in a swirl of ambition to excel and succeed. By my mid-thirties, I had graduated with an MBA and a PhD, worked as a management consultant, founded and led (and two years later, much humbled, bore witness to a fire sale of) a Web 1.0 tech startup in Silicon Valley, and taken on a teaching career at Columbia Business School. From the outside, I was inhabiting a gilded world. But from within, I had a gnawing feeling that my life might hurtle toward its final act without my ever having come close to living it. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 高中时，我热衷于研究心理学，以推进我从信仰和哲学中了解到的人性。我认为这可能是通往我所寻求的转变的途径。但是我努力地与这一主题联系起来。当时，在20世纪80年代，心理学专注于我们内心的黑暗，而不是光明--精神分裂症、抑郁症和创伤，而不是天才、快乐和繁荣。所以我放弃了在大学主修心理学的计划。我把探索我的最大潜力作为一种安静的、内在的追求，而在外面，我被卷进了追求卓越和成功的野心漩涡。到了三十多岁，我已经获得了MBA和博士学位，担任了管理顾问，在硅谷创立并领导了一家Web 1.0技术创业公司（两年后，我非常谦虚地见证了该公司的火速出售），并在哥伦比亚大学商学院从事教学工作。从外面看，我正居住在一个镀金的世界里。但从内心来说，我有一种咬牙切齿的感觉，我的生命可能会匆匆走向它的最后一幕，而我却从未接近过它。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> So I unsheathed the soul-searching swords I had acquired over the years—meditation, writing, reflection, retreats, and conversations with truth-seeking monks—and sent them to battle with that ultimate question, “What should I do with my life?” The answer was vague at first. It took a few years to come into sharper relief, but when it did, it was resoundingly clear. I wanted to dissolve the boundaries between my inner life and outer life, and translate my passion for pursuing my highest potential into a teaching that could help others approach their own. Case closed. I had finally, with my hair now more salt than pepper, figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up. After my excursions into mathematics, consulting, and entrepreneurship, I had come back full circle to the same question that I had been so drawn to as a ten-year-old: What is the highest peak one can scale in a well-trekked life? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 因此，我拔出多年来获得的反省之剑--冥想、写作、反思、闭关，以及与寻求真理的僧侣的对话--并将它们送去与那个终极问题作战，"我的生活应该怎么做？"起初，答案是模糊的。它花了几年时间才变得更加清晰，但当它出现时，它是响亮的清晰。我想消除我的内在生活和外在生活之间的界限，并将我追求自己最高潜力的热情转化为可以帮助他人接近自己的教学。案子结束了。我终于明白了，我的头发现在是盐多于胡椒，我长大后想成为什么。在我对数学、咨询和创业的探索之后，我又回到了10岁时被吸引的同一个问题上。什么是一个人一生中可以攀登的最高峰？ </p></div>

<p class ="en"> My goal in this book is to help us find universal laws of human nature that can guide us to our true nature—our highest potential—and to demonstrate that when we live in harmony with these laws, we create the conditions for outer success and impact. We will arrive at these laws by studying the common ground that is emerging between ancient wisdom, drawn from the great scriptures, and the science of human nature, drawn from psychology, psychotherapy, neuroscience, sociology, behavioral economics, and medicine. When you come across statements like “Science has shown…,” “Research shows…,” or “A scientific experiment…,” you will find corresponding references in the Sources section at the end of the book. I have benefited greatly from the dialogs and partnerships I’ve had over the last sixteen years with leading experts on the fast-evolving science of human nature, including David Burns, Dan Siegel, Richie Davidson, Angela Duckworth, Albert Bandura, Carol Dweck, Amy Edmondson, James Doty, Jamil Zaki, and Scott Barry Kaufman.

<p class ="en"> And finally, I draw from my research of transformative figures from history—people who have led storied lives, pursued noble causes, and inspired others to achieve great things. When we hear anecdotes from the lives of those who inspire us, we unconsciously start to walk in their shoes. We are transported to their time and place, and their story becomes our story. We start to bring them into  our world to inform and inspire our own choices. Research shows that in your day-to-day moments, if you bring a role model to mind who exemplifies a certain quality you are inspired by, you are more likely to act out that quality yourself. If, for instance, you admire your mother for her compassion, then if you think of your mother when you are interacting with someone in need, you are more likely to act compassionately. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 最后，我从我对历史上变革性人物的研究中得出结论--这些人过着传奇的生活，追求崇高的事业，并激励他人实现伟大的事业。当我们听到那些激励我们的人的生活轶事时，我们不自觉地开始穿上他们的鞋子。我们被带到了他们的时间和地点，他们的故事变成了我们的故事。我们开始把他们带入 我们的世界，为我们自己的选择提供信息和启发。研究表明，在你的日常时刻，如果你把一个榜样带到脑海中，他体现了你受到启发的某种品质，你就更有可能自己表现出这种品质。例如，如果你钦佩你母亲的同情心，那么当你与有需要的人交往时，如果你想到你的母亲，你就更有可能采取同情心的行动。 </p></div>

I became depressed and lost all motivation to pursue a career. After a few months, I started to notice that my dog, Pluto, was becoming blind. He would walk around the house bumping into objects, struggling to get to his food bowl or to the family. And yet I noticed he did not lose his zest for life--he continued to wag his tail all the time and walk around friskily. It woke me up. “If Pluto can be so inspired to seize each day even while he is losing his sight,” I asked myself, “then how can I be losing my motivation over this one setback? I still have so much of life ahead of me!” Pluto cured me of my depression. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In Part Two of the book I will showcase the Inner Mastery, Outer Impact journeys of five inspiring figures from history: Eleanor Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi. On the surface, there’s not much in common between these people and you. They lived in different times, played different roles, and likely had different personalities from you. And yet if you expand your thinking about them, you will see that they were, like you and me, on a human journey. They had their dreams, like we have ours.  They had their failings and failures, like we have ours. There were a lot of things not in their control. And yet they kept going and growing, and that’s what made the paths they took increasingly luminous over the course of their lives. I hope to show you some of the small steps these five individuals took. </p></div>

It was my birthday, and he came home with a big smile on his face. He had a surprise for me, he said. We got in our car and he drove me up the highway. We stopped at a car dealership.

This inner light is what all the great ones have sought, within themselves and within humanity. At the height of America’s gravest national crisis, the Civil War, as President Lincoln faced fierce criticism from all corners of the country, he once reflected, “It is my ambition and desire to administer the affairs of the government [such] that if at the end I should have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend remaining and that one shall be down inside of me.” </p></div>

By all conventional measures, Alfred was a success. But one day in 1888 his comfortable world was shaken when he woke up to read his own obituary in the newspapers.

We live with family members we feel emotionally distanced from; we feel disengaged from our job but fearful about trying out a new path; we feel the pressure to conform to others’ expectations even though they do not make sense to us or seem downright wrong. The waters of life are often muddy, and our spirit strains to be in full bloom. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Some of us deal with these dilemmas by splitting life into two parallel tracks, seeking to live authentically in our personal sphere while chasing earthly glory on the outside. When we do this, we never fully occupy either space. That’s how I was operating in my teens and twenties. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Others divide life into two phases. Phase one is the here-and-now pursuit of outer accomplishment in which we strive to earn a lot of money, achieve success at work, outshine our peers, and find security and validation. Phase two is the “sometime in the future” pursuit of inner success—becoming the people we want to be. I have witnessed this approach in some of my MBA students. In their quest for relevance and rewards, they see no option but to go after the most coveted and highly paid careers, even when they care little for the organization they will work for, the customer they will serve, or the product they will be making or marketing. They promise themselves that once their outer hungers have been fed, they will feed their inner yearnings and become their true selves. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 还有人把人生分为两个阶段。第一阶段是当下对外部成就的追求，我们努力赚很多钱，在工作中获得成功，超越我们的同龄人，并找到安全感和认可感。第二阶段是 "未来的某一天 "对内在成功的追求--成为我们想成为的人。我在我的一些MBA学生身上见证了这种方法。为了追求相关性和回报，他们认为除了追求最令人羡慕的高薪职业外别无选择，即使他们对将要工作的组织、将要服务的客户或将要制造或营销的产品不感兴趣。他们向自己承诺，一旦他们的外在饥渴得到满足，他们将满足内心的渴望，成为真正的自我。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> But too often the compromises struck in phase one become a way of life, and the years speed by without the person ever finding time to explore and express those deeper yearnings.

I won’t sacrifice my authenticity at the altar of outer success.” I applaud you if that’s who you are. But the pursuit of inner success might come at its own cost: the price of diminished earthly rewards. In being unapologetically true to our self, we may end up hurting, disappointing, or antagonizing others, leading to strained relationships and lost opportunities. Doors may shut because people in our personal and professional circles feel that we are not attuned to their needs, not flexible or collaborative in our approach. And even if we attain power and influence, we may be feared, perhaps respected, but not admired or loved. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Investor Warren Buffett has put it this way: “The big question about how people behave is whether they’ve got an Inner Scorecard or an Outer Scorecard.” Or, as he puts it, what if you had to choose between being the best investor in the world, even though the world thinks you are the worst, or being the worst investor in the world, even though the world thinks you are the best? Which would it be for you—inner or outer? </p></div>

<p class ="en"> How distressing to have to strike such a Faustian bargain! Could we not have them both? Let’s go back and look at Buffett for a moment. He has reflected, “[My dad] was a hundred percent Inner Scorecard guy.… He taught me how life should be lived,” and “As you move along in your career, you always want to consider your Inner Scorecard—how you feel about your own performance and success. You should worry more about how well you perform rather than how well the rest of the world perceives your performance.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> These are not mere words. By all accounts, Buffett has lived with an inner scorecard. After graduating from Columbia Business School, he made many contrarian moves that put him at odds with convention. He ran his investment business from Omaha, Nebraska, not Wall Street; he made an immense fortune but lives till this day not in a mansion but in the same home that he bought in 1958; he didn’t succumb to the temptation to invest in internet and telecom stocks during the Web 1.0 stock market boom (and subsequent bust), even when critics like Harry Newton, publisher of  Technology Investor  magazine, in early 2000 were claiming, “Warren Buffett should say, ‘I’m sorry.’ How did he miss the silicon, wireless, DSL, cable, and biotech revolutions?”; he resisted the financial world’s fascination with day trading and chose instead to focus on stocks that promise long-term value creation. And he has donated most of his money to social causes. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这些并不只是说说而已。从各方面来看，巴菲特一直带着内心的记分卡生活。从哥伦比亚大学商学院毕业后，他做了许多逆向思维的举动，使他与传统观念相悖。他在内布拉斯加州的奥马哈，而不是在华尔街经营他的投资业务；他赚取了巨大的财富，但直到今天，他不是住在豪宅里，而是住在1958年买的那栋房子里；在Web 1.0的股市繁荣期（以及随后的破产），他没有屈服于投资互联网和电信股票的诱惑，即使在2000年初，像《 技术投资者》 杂志出版人哈里-牛顿这样的批评家声称，"沃伦-巴菲特应该说，'我很抱歉。他怎么会错过硅、无线、DSL、电缆和生物技术革命呢？"；他抵制了金融界对日间交易的迷恋，而是选择关注那些有望长期创造价值的股票。而且他把自己的大部分钱都捐给了社会事业。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> It has been through his commitment to inner success—to being true to himself and following his own inner code—that Warren Buffett has achieved extraordinary outer success.

What we did, what we ate, what we wore, how we danced, how we grieved, how we loved—every bead of our life’s necklace was picked for us, not by us. Your path was not  your  path, but a well-paved and well-trodden road on which you were meant to march to an orderly beat based on your station in life. If you fell out of line, woe be to you! You were then a black sheep, a heathen, an outcast, a renegade, a rebel, a witch, a deranged mind, possibly possessed by the devil, and certainly headed for eternal damnation. You would thus deservedly be castigated, ostracized, exorcised, excommunicated, exiled, imprisoned, conquered, enslaved, or maybe even impaled. </p></div>

A nation called the United States of America loftily proclaimed that it was every individual’s birthright to enjoy “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” an ideal that it is still perfecting in practice. People in many regions of the world today are shedding the shackles of conformity, rebelling against social restrictions that limit their freedom of thought, speech, and action.

By indulging whatever urge arises within us, we entangle ourselves in the web of instant gratification. We may feel authentic, validated, and free in the moment, but over time we grow increasingly trapped in our impulses, habits, and weaknesses, which keep us far from our full potential. Science has shown that our long-term outcomes—in terms of health, happiness, high performance, and harmony in relationships—become highly compromised when we habitually choose immediate over delayed gratification. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The figures from history who have inspired us understood that there were times when it was critical that they rein in their thoughts, feelings, and desires rather than allow them full expression. Take Abraham Lincoln. He was president of the United States when the nation went to war with itself. As commander in chief of the Union army, in the days before telecommunications, Lincoln stayed in constant contact with his generals through letters sent back and forth by messengers from the White House to the battlefront. He used the letters to counsel, coax, and, where needed, castigate the generals. In one such letter to General Hooker, Lincoln wrote, “During  Gen. Burnside’s command of the Army, you… thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country.… I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the Army, of criticizing their Commander, and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you.” In a letter to General Meade he wrote, “I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape. He was within your easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely.… Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 那些激励过我们的历史人物明白，有些时候，他们必须控制自己的思想、感情和欲望，而不是让它们充分表达。以亚伯拉罕-林肯为例。当国家与自己开战时，他是美国的总统。作为联邦军队的总司令，在电信之前的日子里，林肯通过信使从白宫到战斗前线来回发送的信件与他的将军们保持着持续的联系。他用这些信来劝说、哄骗，并在必要时指责将军们。 在一封写给胡克将军的信中，林肯写道："在伯恩赛德将军指挥军队期间，你......尽可能地阻挠他，这对国家来说是一个巨大的错误....，我很担心你在军队中帮助灌输的批评他们的指挥官和不信任他的精神，现在会转到你身上。"在给米德将军的信中，他写道："我相信你不了解李的逃跑所涉及的不幸的严重性。他本来在你的掌握之中，如果对他下手，再加上我们最近取得的其他胜利，战争就会结束。现在的情况是，战争将被无限期地延长，....，你的黄金机会已经消失了，我因此而感到非常痛苦。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Historians have discovered myriad such letters in which Lincoln criticized his generals for their conduct of the war. But, remarkably, many of these letters were unsigned and unsent. Discovered in Lincoln’s presidential desk in the White House after his passing, they are aptly called Lincoln’s hot letters. (The one to General Hooker was signed and dispatched to its recipient, while the one to General Meade was unsigned and unsent.) </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 历史学家发现了无数这样的信件，林肯在其中批评了他的将军们的战争行为。但是，值得注意的是，这些信件中有许多没有签名，也没有发送。在林肯去世后，他在白宫的总统办公桌上发现了这些信，它们被恰当地称为林肯的热信。(给胡克将军的那封是有签名的，并且已经寄给了收信人，而给米德将军的那封则没有签名，也没有寄出）。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Why did Lincoln write hot letters that were never sent to the intended audience? Perhaps he recognized as he was writing that he was in the grip of anger and it would be better to sleep on things, to look the missive over in the morning when he was calmer and better able to operate with wisdom. Perhaps he realized that by expressing himself so freely he might demoralize the recipient or alienate them at a time when he desperately needed their commitment and their loyalty. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 林肯为什么要写那些从未寄给预定听众的热信？也许他在写的时候就意识到自己正处于愤怒之中，最好是睡一觉，等明天早上冷静下来后再看信，这样才能更有智慧地操作。也许他意识到，在他迫切需要收信人的承诺和忠诚的时候，他如此自由地表达自己，可能会打击收信人的士气或疏远他们。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> What ensued between them was not made known to me at that time, but my father shared it many years later with me. The physician told my father that he had two pieces of bad news. One, they would need to perform the surgery that very evening—he had determined it would not be safe to wait a week. And two, because of a medical issue I had, they would not be able to give me anesthesia, so the surgery would need to be performed without it. </p></div>

The first is that the doctor says you can actually have that surgery  today —he does not need to wait a week. So you’ll recover over the next three days and then will be back at home instead of waiting another week. And the second good news is that they have been observing you at this hospital, and you are the bravest teenager they have seen! They don’t even believe you need any anesthesia when he performs the surgery. It may hurt a little here and there, but you’ll get through it fine, because you’re so brave. I am so proud of you.” </p></div>

My team included our manager, Sheila, another associate, Jeremy, and a business analyst, Martin. ii  Within one week, it was clear to me that as a manager, Sheila was a disaster. She never smiled, she kept to herself, and she acknowledged our presence only when she needed to give instructions or review our work. She did not invite us into important meetings, nor did she update us on key developments on the project. I vividly remember an occasion when I finally got a chance to present my work to a senior McKinsey director who was spending a rare, prized half hour with us. This was going to be my moment. Our audience with him was all I thought of for forty-eight hours. As I launched into my presentation, Sheila stared at me unblinkingly, pursed her lips, and made a rapid circling gesture with her forefinger. My very soul was pierced by her searing message: “Speed up, Hitendra! This is a senior director you are speaking to.  He has no time to waste. Do you really need to explain that pie chart to him in this much detail? He can read and think  very  fast. C’mon, be quick!” My moment of glory was over in a flash. </p></div>

He walked into the team room each day and instantly lifted our spirits with his broad smile and infectious humor. He would approach Sheila, speak to her in a soothing voice, perk her up by finding something to appreciate about her, then nudge her toward the behavior he was seeking.  Could Sheila make sure to include him in the client meeting where his research was going to be reviewed?

<p class ="en"> The idea of being everything and the complete opposite may sound inauthentic and unachievable. And yet I have found that those who have left a luminous mark on history have practiced this seeming contradiction, changing their behavior from moment to moment, embracing complexity and paradox, holding opposites in balance within themselves. Josiah Holland, one of Abraham Lincoln’s earliest biographers, wrote, “The writer has conversed with multitudes of men who claimed to know Mr. Lincoln intimately; yet there are not two of the whole number who agree in their estimate of him. The fact was that he rarely showed more than one aspect of himself to one man. He opened himself to men in different directions.” Holland goes on to recount the different qualities people attributed to Lincoln: “A very ambitious man.” “Without a particle of ambition.” “One of the saddest men that ever lived.” “One of the jolliest men that has ever lived.” “The most cunning man in America.” “Has not a particle of cunning in him.” “A leader of the people.” “Always led by the people.” “Cool and impassive.” “Susceptible to the strongest passions.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 成为一切和完全相反的人的想法可能听起来不真实，无法实现。然而，我发现，那些在历史上留下光辉印记的人都在实践这种看似矛盾的做法，时刻改变自己的行为，拥抱复杂性和矛盾性，在自己内心保持对立面的平衡。亚伯拉罕-林肯最早的传记作者之一乔赛亚-霍兰（Josiah Holland）写道："作者曾与众多声称密切了解林肯先生的人交谈过；但在所有这些人中，没有两个人对他的评价一致。事实是，他很少向一个人展示自己的一个以上的方面。他在不同的方向上向人们敞开自己。"霍兰接着叙述了人们赋予林肯的不同品质："一个非常有野心的人"。"没有一丝野心。""有史以来最悲哀的人之一。""有史以来最活泼的人之一。""美国最狡猾的人。""他身上没有一丝狡猾。""人民的领袖。""总是被人民所领导。""冷静和无动于衷。""容易受到最强烈的激情的影响。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> But something else was also operating in Lincoln. His friend and law partner for twenty years, William Herndon, observed, “His pursuit of the truth… was indefatigable.… Lincoln loved truth for its own sake.… He saw all things through a perfect mental lens.” Lincoln operated from a steady Core within. He leaned into outer chaos from a place of inner harmony. And that is the thesis I want  to offer you—that when you have mastered your inner game, you become free to play your best outer game. The key to success lies within—in operating from your Inner Core. </p></div>

It creates a space between the triggers you experience—the disappointing email, the challenging question from a colleague at a meeting—and your response to those triggers, empowering you to act with intention rather than instinct. It grounds you on the inside and then empowers you to act in the most impactful way on the outside.

Reflect on moments like this—when you and another individual, you and your family, you and your team, you and an audience felt a kind of fusion of spirit, as though there were only one heart beating in the room.

If you approached your growth as a leader one competency at a time, you’re unlikely to get to a place where you fully embody the discipline. And even if you acquired mastery over multiple skills, you’d never be able to execute seven of them in a half-minute exchange the way Babette did. This competency-based approach was a practical first step to take in the twentieth century as we started to understand and map out the domain of leadership, but now we know a lot more about the science of human nature.

The root cause is an inability to activate the Core in yourself or others.

<p class ="en"> Steve entered a world where high-tech products abounded with features but had poor design and usability. Think of a personal computer with a thick user manual, or a mobile phone with thirty buttons. Businesses at that time believed that technology couldn’t be made easy to use or elegant in design, and that consumers only cared about features and low price. Steve took a contrarian position, obsessing over the simplicity and design of Apple products and then offering them at premium prices. His vision showed early promise, but then came crashing down when Apple floundered. In 1994, while he was out of Apple, he was asked in an interview with  Rolling Stone  magazine if he still believed in the limitless potential of technology. Jobs answered, “Oh sure. It’s not a faith in technology. It’s a faith in people… that they’re basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they’ll do wonderful things with them.” Jobs said he believed that people “care about things that are beautifully conceived and well made.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 史蒂夫进入了一个高科技产品比比皆是，但设计和可用性很差的世界。想想看，一台个人电脑有一本厚厚的用户手册，或者一部手机有30个按钮。当时的企业认为，技术不可能变得易于使用或设计优雅，而消费者只关心功能和低价。史蒂夫采取了相反的立场，执着于苹果产品的简单性和设计，然后以高价提供。他的愿景显示出早期的前景，但当苹果公司陷入困境时，他的愿景也随之崩塌了。1994年，当他离开苹果公司时，他在接受 《滚石》 杂志采访时被问及是否仍然相信技术的无限潜力。乔布斯回答说："哦，当然。这不是对技术的信仰。这是一种对人的信仰......他们基本上是善良和聪明的，如果你给他们工具，他们就会用它们做美妙的事情。"乔布斯说，他相信人们 "关心那些构思精美、制作精良的东西"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief designer, later reflected on a conversation he had with Jobs close to the end of Jobs’s life—about whether they had been successful. “I think Steve felt a vindication.… It wasn’t a vindication of ‘I’m right’ or ‘I told you so.’ It was a vindication that restored his sense of faith in humanity. Given the choice, people do discern and value quality more than we give them credit for.” In another reflection, Ive has shared how he believes consumers “will sense the care that went into [making beautiful products].… I do  believe [people] are capable of discerning far more than [they] are capable of articulating.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 苹果公司的首席设计师乔纳森-伊夫（Jonathan Ive）后来回顾了他与乔布斯在接近乔布斯生命终点时的一次谈话--关于他们是否成功。"我认为史蒂夫感到一种平反....，这不是一种'我是对的'或'我告诉过你'的平反。这是一种平反，恢复了他对人类的信仰感。如果有选择，人们对质量的辨别和重视比我们给予他们的评价要高"。在另一次反思中，艾维分享了他如何相信消费者 "会感觉到[制造美丽产品]的关怀....，我确实 ，相信[人们]的辨别能力远远超过[他们]的表达能力。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Steve Jobs was able to peer into a certain nook within our souls. There, he saw an appreciation for simplicity, perfection, beauty, and creativity. Many of us may not have been aware that these qualities existed within us, which is why he wasn’t interested in using market research to ask people what they wanted. But unlike most business owners of that era, he had faith that when the time came, people would intuitively gravitate toward products that express these attributes. His faith in us has today transformed the world, much beyond Apple, as businesses embrace design thinking—a commitment to going beyond features and price to designing products in the most appealing and intuitive way. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> These are  simple  actions. After all, it took Babette an average of seven seconds to execute each of them (thirty-five seconds, five actions). Perhaps that is why inspiring leaders have never needed formal leadership training. Warren Buffett once shared, “You don’t need to have extraordinary effort to achieve extraordinary results. You just need to do the ordinary, everyday things exceptionally well.” Although these actions are “ordinary,” to have the right impact they need to be done “exceptionally well.” For instance, take Babette’s second action, appreciate. Imagine if while she was appreciating Gordon’s writing abilities on the outside, she was feeling and thinking something quite different on the inside, like, “He’s so pompous about his writing!” Or “Why does he care so much about the writing? This isn’t a college textbook. It’s a research report!” Or “What a grouchy man! We’ve gotten such great results over this last year, and all he cares about is the grammar!” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这些都是 简单的 动作。毕竟，巴贝特平均花了七秒钟来执行每一个动作（三十五秒，五个动作）。也许这就是为什么鼓舞人心的领导人从来不需要正式的领导力培训。沃伦-巴菲特曾经分享过："你不需要有非凡的努力来取得非凡的结果。你只需要把普通的、日常的事情做得特别好"。尽管这些行动是 "普通的"，但要产生正确的影响，就需要做得 "特别好"。例如，以芭贝特的第二个行动--欣赏为例。想象一下，当她在外表上欣赏戈登的写作能力时，她的内心却在感受和思考一些完全不同的东西，比如，"他对自己的写作太浮夸了！"或者 "他为什么这么关心写作？这又不是大学课本。这是一份研究报告！"或者 "真是个爱发牢骚的人!我们去年取得了这么好的成绩，而他关心的只是语法！" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> If that were the case, then it’s quite possible that Gordon would have sensed from her tone of voice and facial expressions that her appreciation was not genuine. Even if she’d fooled Gordon into  believing that she meant it, if a disconnect between what she was saying on the outside and what she was thinking and feeling on the inside became a regular thing for her, she would over time have started to feel increasingly disconnected and unfulfilled at work. So, to appreciate Gordon, Babette first had to look inside herself to find something she genuinely admired him for. Only then did she earn the right to appreciate him on the outside. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 如果是这样的话，那么很可能戈登会从她的语气和面部表情中感觉到她的赞赏并不真诚。 即使她欺骗了戈登，让他相信她是真心的，如果她在外面说的话与她内心的想法和感受之间的脱节成为她的常态，那么随着时间的推移，她会开始感到越来越脱节，在工作中越来越不满足。因此，为了欣赏戈登，芭贝特首先必须审视自己的内心，找到她真正钦佩他的地方。只有这样，她才有权利在外面欣赏他。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In this way, your every action starts by first being an  inner  action. You have to activate the right energy on the inside by moving your feelings, thoughts, and intention to the right place, anchored in your Core. Once you’ve achieved this, you can more naturally express the same energy on the outside, as an  outer  action, to help move the other party’s feelings, thoughts, and behavior to the right place. Leadership thus becomes a series of inner and outer actions to bring out the best in ourselves and others. In the past, leadership training has essentially ignored the inner action that has to precede the outer. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这样一来，你的每一个行动首先是一个 内在 行动。你必须通过把你的感觉、思想和意图转移到正确的地方，锚定在你的核心，从而激活内部的正确能量。一旦你做到了这一点，你就可以更自然地在外部表达同样的能量，作为一个 外部 行动，帮助对方的感情、思想和行为转移到正确的位置。因此，领导力成为一系列内在和外在的行动，以发挥我们自己和他人的优点。在过去，领导力培训基本上忽略了必须先于外部的内在行动。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A biochemistry textbook tells us, “The stunning variety of living systems belies a striking similarity. The common use of DNA and the genetic code by all organisms underlies one of the most powerful discoveries of the past century—namely, that organisms are remarkably uniform at the molecular level.” We encounter this idea everywhere: incredible diversity on the outside, remarkable uniformity on the inside. Countless liquids, solids, and gases, built from only 118 or so elements. A vast array of books and words, using the same twenty-six letters of the alphabet. Millions of melodies, played from just twelve notes in the Western musical scale. And now, a wide range of behaviors, built from a few actions. Mastering leadership is simple when you focus on learning one action at a time. And yet with every such small step, you are taking a big leap in expanding the set of behaviors (action paths) you can select from. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Winston Churchill always sought to be in the middle of the action. He was keen to participate in every battle Britain fought in his lifetime, if not as part of the military, then as a journalist covering the action or as a leader commanding the course of the war. At the age of twenty-one, he traveled to Cuba to observe its war of independence, and then he joined with Spanish troops to suppress independence fighters. Two years later, he was at it again, participating in battles in northwest India. He used his contacts with the British prime minister to get assigned to a war in Egypt and then in Sudan. He once gave skin from his arm for a graft for an injured officer—talk about having skin in the game. Later he participated in the Boer Wars in South Africa, where he was caught by the enemies and became a prisoner of war, only to plot and execute his own escape. During World War I, he was a cabinet minister in charge of the British navy. He resigned this position after a disastrous battle in Gallipoli, Turkey. So what did he do next? Join the army as a major and proceed to the battlefront. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Science formulates hypotheses, runs experiments, collects observations, and draws fact-based conclusions. In recent years, the science of human nature has advanced in powerful ways. In the past, psychologists focused almost exclusively on mental maladies like depression and schizophrenia. Today they have turned their attention from human suffering to human flourishing. There is now a boom in research on topics like gratitude, grit, and giving; mindfulness, mindsets, and meaning; charisma, compassion, and creativity. Compelling findings are emerging on what it takes for people to live happy and healthy lives, thrive in relationships, and achieve peak performance at work. Neuroscientists have developed advanced instrumentation like fMRI to map brain networks associated with different behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Now we have a way to investigate the hardware of human potential—neurons forming and performing, firing and wiring—and to study how our physical health and well-being are linked to our thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and lifestyle. Sociology is going through a distinct shift in favor of evidence-based policies—rather than conceptual models—to guide social change. Behavioral economics has made valuable contributions to our understanding of the pitfalls in human reasoning and how they can be surmounted to improve decision-making. The tree of scientific knowledge about human nature is coming into full bloom, and we will pluck actively from its many branches in this book. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Yet science has its limits. Its discoveries and teachings keep evolving as we learn more. The underlying laws of human nature do not change, but science’s understanding of them does. In recent times, for instance, the field of psychology has been going through a “replication crisis” in which serious doubts have been cast on a number of its findings because the experimental results generated by the  original researcher could not be subsequently reproduced by other psychologists. By one estimate, more than half of psychological experiments have failed to replicate. Further, the studies that have failed replication are much more likely to be widely cited—in other words, are the ones we are much more likely to learn about. That should give us some pause in the degree to which we can lean on the science of human nature at this stage of its evolution. These challenges to the scientific enterprise are a humbling reminder that while the ideal of science is objective, scientists ultimately are human, prone to pitfalls in their reasoning and motivations, just like the rest of us. Charles Sidney Burwell, when he was dean of Harvard Medical School, once candidly said to his students, “Half of what we are going to teach you is wrong, and half of it is right. Our problem is that we don’t know which half is which.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 然而，科学有其局限性。它的发现和教义随着我们学习的深入而不断发展。人性的基本规律不会改变，但科学对它们的理解会改变。例如，近来，心理学领域一直在经历 "复制危机"，其中一些研究结果受到严重质疑，因为由 原始研究人员产生的实验结果随后无法被其他心理学家复制。根据一项估计，超过一半的心理学实验未能复制。此外，那些未能复制的研究更有可能被广泛引用--换句话说，是那些我们更有可能了解的研究。这应该让我们对在人性科学演变的这个阶段，我们能在多大程度上依靠人性科学有所顾忌。对科学事业的这些挑战是一个令人惭愧的提醒，虽然科学的理想是客观的，但科学家最终也是人，容易在他们的推理和动机中出现陷阱，就像我们其他人一样。查尔斯-西德尼-伯维尔（Charles Sidney Burwell）在担任哈佛大学医学院院长时，曾坦率地对他的学生说："我们要教给你们的东西有一半是错的，有一半是对的。我们的问题是，我们不知道哪一半是什么"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Besides, science still lacks the tools to study certain aspects of human nature. For example, meditation is an ancient and highly effective discipline, discovered by unknown truth-seekers thousands of years ago. In the past, there was limited interest in meditation among scientists, both because existing instruments couldn’t measure subtle changes in the brain, and because of skepticism about its value. After all, if you were an ambitious, can-do, success-driven individual, why would you sit down, become still, close your eyes, and do essentially “nothing”? Today, however, scientists have instrumentation advanced enough to measure subtle changes in the brain. They have opened up to take an interest in this practice, and so an explosion of scientific findings are now detailing the benefits of meditation. But even this bustling science is still playing catch-up to what has long been known by practitioners of certain spiritual traditions. Thirty years ago, if you had leaned exclusively on science, you would have never considered meditation a pathway to advancing your potential. Your entire life might have gone by without science revealing this powerful, beautiful truth to you. What other powerful, beautiful truths might science be failing to reveal to us today? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 此外，科学仍然缺乏研究人性的某些方面的工具。例如，冥想是一门古老而高效的学科，是几千年前由不知名的求真者发现的。过去，科学家们对冥想的兴趣有限，一方面是因为现有的仪器无法测量大脑中的微妙变化，另一方面是因为对其价值持怀疑态度。毕竟，如果你是一个雄心勃勃、敢作敢为、追求成功的人，你为什么要坐下来，变得静止，闭上眼睛，基本上 "什么都不做"？然而，今天，科学家们拥有足够先进的仪器来测量大脑的微妙变化。他们已经对这种做法产生了兴趣，因此现在有大量的科学发现详细说明了冥想的好处。但是，即使是这种热闹的科学仍然在追赶某些精神传统的修行者早已知道的东西。三十年前，如果你完全依靠科学，你永远不会认为冥想是提高你潜力的途径。你的整个生命可能已经过去了，而科学却没有向你揭示这个强大、美丽的真理。今天，科学还可能没有向我们揭示哪些强大而美丽的真理？ </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In my own investigation of human potential, I learned about an advanced and ancient meditation technique, Kriya Yoga, from  the Self-Realization Fellowship lessons of Paramahansa Yogananda, known as the founding father of yoga in the West. Yogananda’s teachings have been a central force in my life. Kriya Yoga works with a subtle form of life energy that flows within your body, called prana. (In ancient Chinese wisdom, it is called  chi .) Kriya teaches you to direct the flow of prana within your spine and brain in ways that make you experience increasingly deeper states of peace, joy, and love. Prana is likely not detectable by today’s scientific tools. Does that mean prana does not exist? In centuries past, scientific instruments were not advanced enough to detect the invisible forces of electricity and magnetism, yet none of us would claim that they didn’t exist back then. I do not want to wait for science to advance its technology to validate or invalidate the presence of prana, for I may be dead by the time that happens. When science hasn’t progressed enough yet, what is a truth-seeker to do? Become, I would offer, your own inner scientist. </p></div>

The outer lab requires evidence from the five physical senses, but the inner lab can draw additional data directly from our feelings, thoughts, and intuition. Truth-seekers have in centuries past pursued inner experiments to accelerate their knowing. Several centuries ago, for example, one man actively investigated pathways to his Inner Core. He took on certain forms of austerity, including minimal eating and breath control, but got no meaningful results. He concluded that this kind of physical deprivation was not helping him realize his true nature. He abandoned one experiment, then began another. Eventually he took on the practice of meditation and a path of balanced living, succeeded at his goal, and became the Buddha. The rest is history, some of it still in the making. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> By 2002, it had become clear to me that I needed to invest in my inner life, so I decided to put Yogananda’s teachings of Kriya Yoga  to test. I formulated three hypotheses: if I pursued these teachings with commitment and devotion, I would (1) experience the presence of prana within me, (2) learn to direct its flow, and (3) feel increasing peace, love, and joy from within as a consequence. I went into my inner laboratory, performed my experiment, and collected my observations. Within weeks, I started to experience the early effects of Kriya. That gave me the confidence to continue, and over time the experience became more tangible, more profound, and more consistent. Today, no outer scientist will be able to convince me that Kriya Yoga is unscientific just because they cannot yet measure prana; my own inner scientist continues to collect daily observations about the existence and benefits of prana flow. No neuroscientist will convince me that, when it comes to human nature, the only part of the body worth studying is the brain, because I have experienced the rewards of also cultivating awareness in the “heart chakra,” a nerve bundle located next to the human heart. Outer science has taken some steps in the last twenty years to compile evidence on the benefits of breathing practices that form a part, but not the whole, of the Kriya method. I am glad I did not wait for this evidence to accrue before becoming my own inner scientist. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> After a tough childhood, Malcolm started to shine as a student. Once he told a white teacher that he was interested in pursuing law as a career, and the teacher told him that as a black person he might  want to consider carpentry instead. At that point, Malcolm dropped out of school. In a few years, he had devolved into a life of petty crime in the streets of Harlem, culminating in his being sentenced to a prison term when he was twenty-one. Prison became a crucible for Malcolm’s personal transformation. In his own words: “Stumbling is not falling.” “To have once been a criminal is no disgrace. To remain a criminal is the disgrace.” “I don’t think anybody ever got more out of going to prison than I did. In the hectic pace of the world today, there is no time for meditation, or for deep thought. A prisoner has time that he can put to good use. I’d put prison second to college as the best place for a man to go if he needs to do some thinking. If he’s motivated, in prison he can change his life.” </p></div>

Malcolm X’s respect for the man steadily increased, and Handler… was an influence upon the inner Malcolm X.… “He’s the most genuinely unprejudiced white man I ever met,” Malcolm X said to me.… I saw Malcolm X too many times exhilarated in after-lecture give-and-take with predominantly white student bodies at colleges and universities to ever believe that he nurtured at his core any blanket white-hatred. “The young whites, and blacks, too, are the only hope that America has,” he said to me once. “The rest of us have always been living in a lie.”… One day in his car, we had stopped for the red light at an intersection; another car with a white man driving had stopped alongside, and when this white man saw Malcolm X, he instantly called across to him, “I don’t blame your people for turning to you. If I were a Negro I’d follow you, too. Keep up  the fight!” Malcolm X said to the man very sincerely, “I wish I could have a white chapter of the people I meet like you.” The light changed, and as both cars drove on, Malcolm X quickly said to me, firmly, “Not only don’t write that, never repeat it.

A powerful way to add to your repository of experiences is to conduct thought experiments and then learn from the inner perceptions that accrue. The greatest scientist of modern times, Einstein, arrived at many of his breakthroughs via thought experiments. At the age of sixteen he asked himself, “What if you could ride alongside a beam of light? What would that be like?” It seemed to him that you would perceive a light wave to be stationary since you were traveling at the same speed. He kept deepening his understanding of this concept for the next ten years until it led to his famous theory of relativity. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Thought experiments allow us to mentally craft experiences on demand and then observe what feelings and insights arise within us. They give us an understanding of our true nature without having to go through a real-life event. When I first started to study Mother Teresa, I found myself deeply inspired by her commitment to serving the poorest among the poor. But I also learned that she had consorted at times with people of disrepute, such as a banker convicted of a crime and a dictator. I wondered why she was not more discriminating in whom she engaged with for her cause. Then I constructed a thought experiment. I visualized that I was traveling in a remote country with a loved one. Our car meets with an accident, and my loved one is seriously injured. Her life is in danger as she bleeds by the side of the road. There is no help in sight. One car passes by on  the road, and despite our entreaties it does not stop. Nor do the next ten. The twelfth car I try to wave down stops to help us. I am overwhelmed with relief. Then I suddenly notice that the driver of the vehicle is a corrupt dictator I have long been critical of. What would I do in that moment? Would I ask him to leave, because I have judged him to be a bad person? Or would I jump at his offer to help, thank him for doing so, and focus on getting my loved one to the nearest hospital? I realized that this was probably what Mother Teresa had experienced. Her loved ones were the street people that most of the world had abandoned like those eleven cars that I had imagined passing my dying loved one. So whoever offered help, she received it with gratitude and without judgment. Her business was not to investigate their lives or support their agenda; it was to attract love, care, and support for the people on the sidewalks that most of us had chosen to pass by. </p></div>

Malcolm’s acceptance of Elijah’s doctrine was absolute.

Yet most prophets and scriptures originated in centuries past; people today receive the teachings in a derivative form based on what has been handed down from the original source through a chain of messengers over the ages. How confident can we be that the interpretation we are receiving is faithful to the original—that no word or idea has been intentionally or unintentionally suppressed, inserted, tweaked, or distorted? When we observe the rivers of blood that have flowed across history in the name of religion, we recognize the perils of blindly following what we are told are a faith’s doctrines. Time and time again, imperfect messengers and institutions have sought to amass power by inducing people to take their word as the prophet’s word, offering interpretations of scriptures that have suited their ambitions. In describing how both the proslavery and antislavery factions in the United States defended their positions during the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln reflected, in his second inaugural address, “Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.” </p></div>

King rejected their interpretation of the Bible and gave churchgoers the challenge of questioning their faith and taking on the true practice of religion. While indicting the Christianity of his time, King stayed firmly rooted in the teachings of Christ. His “Letter from Birmingham Jail” beautifully captures his striving to  understand the truth in Jesus’s teachings: “In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church [in not supporting the Montgomery bus boycott].

Science gathers data from our outer world and spirituality from our inner world. Although the two disciplines may have opposed each other in the past, they are starting to come together. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Science made great strides in the late seventeenth, the eighteenth, and the nineteenth centuries to uncover nature’s secrets, such as through Newton’s laws of motion. This progress lulled some scientists into believing it was only a matter of time before science would yield all the practical knowledge needed to master the universe. But the twentieth century shattered this myth. The more scientists advanced their understanding of nature, the more they were astounded with what they were uncovering about nature at micro and macro scales.  Time slows down as you speed up. An electron is both a particle and a wave. One cannot measure both the position and velocity of an object at the same time. It is impossible for a mathematical system to be both complete and consistent. Matter is in fact condensed energy.  Some pioneering scientists who drove these disruptive advancements turned to spiritual wisdom to help them become more at peace with their logic-defying discoveries about the universe. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, said, “The general notions about human understanding… which are illustrated by discoveries in atomic physics are not in the nature of things wholly unfamiliar, wholly unheard of, or new. Even in our own culture, they have a history, and in Buddhist and Hindu thought a more considerable and central place. What we shall find is an exemplification, an encouragement, and a refinement of old wisdom.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 科学在十七世纪末、十八世纪和十九世纪取得了巨大的进步，揭开了大自然的秘密，例如通过牛顿的运动定律。这种进步使一些科学家相信，科学迟早会产生掌握宇宙所需的所有实用知识，这只是时间问题。但是20世纪打破了这个神话。科学家们对自然界的理解越深入，他们对自己在微观和宏观尺度上发现的自然界的东西就越感到震惊。 时间随着你的速度加快而变慢了。一个电子既是一个粒子又是一个波。人们无法同时测量一个物体的位置和速度。一个数学系统不可能既完整又一致。物质实际上是凝聚的能量。 一些推动这些颠覆性进展的先锋科学家转向精神智慧，以帮助他们更加平和地对待他们关于宇宙的违反逻辑的发现。原子弹之父罗伯特-奥本海默（Robert Oppenheimer）说："关于人类理解的一般概念......由原子物理学的发现所说明的，并不是完全陌生的、完全没有听说过的或新的事物的性质。即使在我们自己的文化中，它们也有历史，而在佛教和印度教思想中，它们有更大的核心地位。我们将发现的是对古老智慧的示范、鼓励和提炼"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As science has expanded its terrain from studying nature to studying human nature, it is arriving at the place described by Oppenheimer. Scientific findings on cultivating compassion, gratitude, self-discipline, emotional mastery, and habit formation, among  other virtues, are “an exemplification, an encouragement, and a refinement of old wisdom.” As scientists push forward along the frontiers of human consciousness through their study of meditation and transcendence, the boundaries between science and spirituality are dissolving even more. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Science is at its best when pursued with a spiritual temperament—with great appreciation for the vast intelligence in nature, a sense of awe about all that is yet unknown, a spirit of humble inquiry shorn of one’s ego, an opening of one’s consciousness to new, uplifting experiences, and a pure-hearted devotion to the discovery of truth. Spirituality, in turn, is at its best when pursued with a scientific temperament; if a spiritual path we are pursuing does not, over time, make us increasingly peaceful, wise, loving, and joyful, well then, scientifically speaking, something isn’t right—either the teaching itself, or our understanding of it, or how we are putting it into practice. The rapid growth in the numbers of yoga, mindfulness, and meditation practitioners in recent years beyond those disciplines’ Hindu and Buddhist origins has occurred in part because their teachings do not ask for blind faith; rather, they yield, in an observable, tangible, step-by-step way, the promised benefits. “Yoga,” Yogananda once said, is “the science of the soul.” </p></div>

I thought the only way we could solve our problem of segregation was an armed revolt.… Then one Sunday afternoon I traveled to Philadelphia to hear a sermon by Dr. Mordecai Johnson, president of Howard University.… Dr. Johnson had just returned from a trip to India, and, to my great interest, he spoke of the life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.… His message was so profound and electrifying that I left the meeting and bought a half-dozen books on Gandhi’s life and works.… Prior to reading Gandhi, I had about concluded that the ethics of Jesus were only effective in individual relationships. The “turn the other cheek” philosophy and the “love your enemies” philosophy were only valid, I felt, when individuals were in conflict with other individuals; when racial groups and nations were in conflict a more realistic approach seemed necessary. But after reading Gandhi, I saw how utterly mistaken I was. Gandhi was probably the first person in history to lift the love ethic of Jesus above mere interaction between individuals to a powerful and effective social force on a large scale. </p></div>

Gandhi began an active correspondence with Tolstoy that lasted until Tolstoy’s death, and he called Tolstoy “the greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced.” In addition to his deeply held Christian beliefs, Tolstoy himself was influenced by certain practices in Buddhism and Hinduism to which he’d been introduced by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Some of us have walked away from a faith that we were introduced to in our family and culture because we have felt uncomfortable with the choices and behaviors it imposed on us. I found myself in this situation in my teens, ready to walk away from my Hindu roots, for I felt stifled by rules and rituals that made no sense to me. But instead of abandoning it, I ventured deeper into it. I sought to investigate Hinduism in terms of its fundamental precepts, and then the breakthroughs came. I realized that Hinduism has an extrinsic form (the outer rituals, the dos and don’ts that are the tradition’s visible expressions) and an intrinsic form (the basic beliefs, principles, values, and inner practices that silently guide the practitioners on their spiritual journeys). And over time I realized this is true of other faiths as well. We tend to identify with the extrinsic form—the customs and rituals—and to do less of the inner work that would harmonize us with the intrinsic form. The extrinsic form is situational—what may work today may not work tomorrow, as conditions change—while the intrinsic form is timeless. The extrinsic form makes world faiths look very different, while the intrinsic form makes them look more similar. The extrinsic form can create divisions, while the intrinsic form always unites. When we open up to the intrinsic form of the great religions, we may find ourselves stumbling into our own faith in unexpected places, as I did in Istanbul, Jericho, and Tel Aviv. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Ten years ago, I found myself at the Istanbul airport. With my flight departure still a few hours away, I took a seat in a passenger waiting area and closed my eyes to meditate. I do not know how much time had passed before I felt a tap on my shoulder. I opened my eyes to find a man towering over me in flowing Arab robes, peering down at me with keen interest. He gestured toward the flight  departure screen, as though to tell me, “You’ve been sitting still for a long time. Let’s make sure you don’t miss your flight.” It became clear that neither of us could speak the other’s language. He seemed to have been affected in some way by how I had been sitting with my attention withdrawn from the world. “Mussulman?” he asked, using the Turkish word for “Muslim.” I shook my head and said, “Hindu.” He seemed unaffected. He sat down beside me, took some food from his pouch, and offered half his loaf of bread and a meatball to me. He himself started eating, and I smiled as a way of thanking him and awkwardly started to eat the bread. As a vegetarian, I wasn’t quite sure what to do with the meatball. Thankfully, he turned away for a moment, and I used that time to tuck the meatball in my pocket. He opened for me a fresh bottle of Sprite, and after I had taken a few sips, he took the bottle and drank from it himself. A deep, silent bond was formed between us. After this simple meal, I smiled and thanked him, stood up, and walked away. A few minutes later, I looked in his direction. He had placed a mat on the floor and was doing his namaz, the act of prayer performed by Muslims five times a day. I realized that this was the source of our kinship; he had seen me go within and connect with my Core, and now he was doing the same. We were fellow travelers to the same destination even though we were taking different flights. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 十年前，我发现自己在伊斯坦布尔机场。离我的航班起飞还有几个小时，我在乘客等候区找了个座位，闭上眼睛冥想。我不知道过了多长时间，我感觉到有人在拍我的肩膀。我睁开眼睛，发现一个穿着飘逸的阿拉伯长袍的男人耸立在我面前，饶有兴趣地俯视着我。他向航班 出发屏幕打手势，似乎在告诉我："你已经坐了很长时间了。让我们确保你不会错过你的航班"。很明显，我们两人都不会说对方的语言。他似乎在某种程度上被我的坐姿所影响，我的注意力从世界中抽离。"穆斯林？"他问，用土耳其语表示 "穆斯林"。我摇了摇头，说："印度教。"他似乎没有受到影响。他在我身边坐下，从他的袋子里拿出一些食物，把他的半个面包和一个肉球给我。他自己开始吃，我微笑着表示感谢，尴尬地开始吃面包。作为一个素食主义者，我不太确定该如何处理肉丸。值得庆幸的是，他转身离开了一会儿，我利用这段时间把肉丸塞进了我的口袋。他为我打开了一瓶新的雪碧，在我喝了几口之后，他拿起瓶子自己喝了起来。我们之间形成了一种深深的、无声的联系。这顿简单的饭后，我微笑着向他表示感谢，站起身来，走了。几分钟后，我朝他的方向看去。他在地板上放了一张垫子，正在做他的namaz，即穆斯林一天做五次的祈祷。我意识到这是我们亲属关系的来源；他看到我进入内心并与我的核心相连，现在他也在这样做。我们是前往同一目的地的同路人，尽管我们乘坐的是不同的航班。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A few years later, I traveled to the Holy Land of Israel accompanied by my mother, wife, and daughter. We sat in awe and stillness at the Wailing Wall to join our hearts with the devout Jews praying at that site. We visited the holy places associated with Jesus’s life in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Jerusalem. Each time we arrived at one of the sites, I asked our loquacious travel guide to pause his commentary, for we wished to transition from the extrinsic to the intrinsic, to go within, to attune ourselves as best we could to Jesus’s spirit, sensing what it must have been like to be in his presence. As the days went by, I privately started to feel disappointed with myself, for I had not been able to calm my mind enough to taste the spiritual nectar I knew was present at these sacred spots we were visiting. It went on that way, from one site to the next. Jesus’s birthplace. The site of the  crucifixion. The ascension. The Last Supper. The Sermon on the Mount. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> And then it happened. We were at the Mount of Temptation, a collection of caves near Jericho, one of the oldest cities in the world. Jesus had gone into seclusion in these caves and fasted for forty days. I sat down yet again to meditate, expecting it to be one more struggle. This time, my mind cleared quickly and became very still. Time and space dissolved, and I felt Jesus’s spirit close to me. His peace, his love, his joy were so palpable. All the soul hunger I had brought to Israel was satisfied in that meditation at the final site we visited. It remains one of my most cherished experiences. I could have spent a lifetime there. </p></div>

But the urge to keep scanning humanity for all its defects was just too strong, and we kept going with our lamentations. After the meal, we took a stroll on Rothschild Boulevard, joining the locals and tourists who were soaking in the relaxed energy of that beautiful street at the evening hour. Out of nowhere, an Orthodox Jew—in his flowing beard, big hat, and black attire—walked up to me, looked me in the eye, and exclaimed, “Be like the bee, not like the fly!” I was taken aback.

<p class ="en"> When I was in high school, I picked up a book from my father’s bookshelf that had a profound impact on me and led, eventually, to the quest that shaped my life: Yogananda’s  Man’s Eternal Quest . It featured topics I was deeply curious about, like “Making Religion Scientific,” “The Universality of Yoga,” “The Soul’s Journey to Perfection,” “How to Read Character,” and “Is God a Father or a Mother?” In reading the book, I never felt it was teaching me anything new; instead, I felt it was awakening me to truths buried deep within that had always been a part of me. Several years later, another compilation of Yogananda’s writings,  The Divine Romance , was published in which he stated, “When those who are receptive hear someone speak truth, it seems so familiar. Their first reaction is ‘I thought so!’ The mind has simply recognized a truth already known intuitively by the soul.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> High up on a mountaintop, a monastery housed an  abbot and some monks. It had once been a thriving community, but in recent years it had fallen on hard times. Few visitors came, donations were down to a trickle, and young men had stopped joining the order. The garden was unkempt, and cobwebs covered the chapel ceiling. Behind this outer decay lay an inner decay. The monks didn’t get along; arguments frequently broke out over petty things, and they blamed one another for their problems. The aging abbot felt greatly demoralized about the future of his beloved monastery but didn’t know what to do. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在 高高的山顶上，有一座寺院，住着一位住 持和一些僧侣。它曾经是一个繁荣的社区，但近年来，它陷入了困境。来访者寥寥无几，捐款也少得可怜，年轻人也不再加入这个组织。花园杂乱无章，小教堂的天花板上布满蜘蛛网。在这种外在的衰败背后是内在的衰败。僧侣们相处不融洽；经常为一些小事发生争执，他们为自己的问题互相指责。年迈的住持对他心爱的寺院的未来感到非常沮丧，但不知道该怎么办。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> One foggy winter evening there was a knock on the monastery’s door. A highly regarded rabbi from the region had come visiting. He stayed for five days. The monks looked after him with great care and respect. It didn’t take him long to observe the monastery’s challenges. On the final day of the rabbi’s visit, the abbot confided in him and sought his counsel. The rabbi nodded, but didn’t offer any answers. Later, as he sat with the monks for dinner one last time, he thanked them for their warm hospitality. Then after a pause, he spoke  again in a hushed tone. “Brothers, I know these are hard times for all of you. But do not despair. I have seen the Messiah. He is right here, among you. Your monastery has a bright future.” Then he bid farewell and left. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在一个有雾的冬天晚上，有人敲响了修道院的门。一位来自该地区的备受推崇的拉比前来拜访。他呆了五天。僧侣们以极大的关怀和尊重照顾他。他没花多长时间就观察到寺院的挑战。在拉比访问的最后一天，住持向他倾诉，寻求他的建议。拉比点了点头，但并没有提供任何答案。后来，当他最后一次与僧侣们坐在一起吃饭时，他感谢了他们的热情款待。然后停顿了一下，他又用沙哑的语气说： 。"兄弟们，我知道这对你们所有人来说都是困难时期。但不要绝望。我已经看到了弥赛亚。他就在这里，在你们中间。你们的寺院有一个光明的未来。"然后他告别并离开了。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The monks were stunned. In the days that followed, they engaged in a flurry of speculation. “If the Messiah is among us, who could it be? Perhaps Brother Patrick? After all, though he is occasionally absent-minded, he is also warm to everyone. Or Brother Nelson? He has a bit of a temper, but it always comes from a place of deep caring for our community. Brother Jacob? He’s constantly berating us about how we’re not on time with our prayers and our meals. We’ve started to avoid his company, but sometimes it feels like it is God who is trying to discipline us through him. Then there’s Brother James, too. He has such humility and devotion in the way he goes about doing his duties, and he never pushes his own ideas. Could it be…  me ? I did join the monastery with a pure purpose, I feel so much peace when I am in the chapel, and two of our monks come to me regularly for guidance on the scriptures.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 僧侣们都惊呆了。在随后的日子里，他们进行了大量的猜测。"如果弥赛亚就在我们中间，会是谁呢？也许是帕特里克修士？毕竟，虽然他偶尔会心不在焉，但他也对每个人都很热情。或者尼尔森弟兄？他的脾气有点大，但总是来自于对我们社区的深切关怀。雅各布弟兄？他经常责备我们，说我们没有按时做祷告和吃饭。我们已经开始避开他的公司，但有时感觉是上帝想通过他来管教我们。然后还有詹姆斯弟兄，也是如此。他在履行职责的过程中表现得如此谦卑和虔诚，而且他从不推崇自己的想法。难道是...... 我 ？我确实是带着纯洁的目的加入修道院的，当我在小教堂里的时候，我感到非常平静，我们的两个和尚经常来找我指导经文。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In small but tangible ways, day upon day, the monks started to change. Now when there was disagreement, they would make an extra effort to respectfully listen to one another. When they passed by a fellow monk, they would nod and smile lovingly. If a monk became irritable, others would give him the space to recover without judgment. They started to discover qualities they much liked in one another. They woke up each day to pray deeply in the chapel, walking out inspired to take on their duties. The monastery became a hive of devotional activity. Residents from neighboring towns started to attend services, seek counseling, and volunteer their time, drawn by the monks’ presence and peaceability.  Some spiritually inclined young men applied to join the order. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 日复一日，僧侣们开始以微小但具体的方式进行改变。现在，当有分歧时，他们会做出额外的努力，尊重地倾听彼此的意见。当他们经过一个僧侣身边时，他们会点头微笑，充满爱意。如果一个和尚变得烦躁，其他人会给他空间来恢复，而不做任何评判。他们开始发现自己非常喜欢对方的品质。他们每天起床后都会在小教堂里深深地祈祷，走出小教堂后就会受到鼓舞，承担起他们的职责。修道院成了一个虔诚的活动场所。邻近城镇的居民开始参加礼拜，寻求咨询，并自愿贡献他们的时间，被修士们的存在和和平性所吸引。 一些有精神倾向的年轻人申请加入该组织。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Occasionally, the abbot’s thoughts would turn to the past, and he would silently marvel at the wisdom of the rabbi whose words had triggered this transformation—and at the faith of the monks in trusting that the Messiah was in fact among them, and within them. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 偶尔，住持的思绪会转向过去，他会默默地赞叹拉比的智慧，他的话语引发了这一转变，也赞叹僧侣们的信心，相信弥赛亚实际上就在他们中间，而且就在他们之中。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I n 2003, I became aware that my life needed a major reboot. Following a period of much introspection, I met with a mentor (let’s call him Brother Arnold) who has been a key force in my life since I was ten. I strode into his office and over the next fifteen minutes proceeded to lay out a fresh blueprint for my future. I had decided, I told him, to walk away from X. Instead, I was going to focus on Y, and start giving time as well to Z. Within two years, I would bring A into focus. Meanwhile, I also wanted to make sure I deepened my commitment to B at home, while not ignoring C along the way. What did he think? Was this a good plan? Was I focusing on the right things, and was I planning them in the right order? I rested my case and took a big breath. Deep down, I was yearning for validation, to be reassured that my choices were right. </p></div>

Then he clasped my hands lovingly in his own, signaling an end to our meeting. My life equation with its X, Y, Z and A, B, C was dead on arrival, so I walked out into the sunshine to give it a quiet burial. </p></div>

For a life well lived, we cannot simply pursue separate goals across different domains; a good life is not just a bucket list of all the things we wish to do before we die.

With no physical landmarks in the vast expanse of ocean around them, seafarers would look up at the night skies for guidance. Most of the stars could not be trusted—their positions change as the Earth moves around the sun. But one star maintains a steady position relative to Earth: the polestar. Sailors used the polestar to navigate their vessels in rough waters and be guided to safe harbor. We, too, can cultivate an inner polestar, a guiding Purpose that helps us navigate our journey in life and leadership toward the destination we wish to arrive at: a life well lived. </p></div>

So instead we take a random walk through the garden of life, plucking all the fruits we can while the sun shines but with no clear destination to reach by sunset. Yet deep down, something gnaws at us as we watch the clock of life ticking. When our spirit is stirred by the story of a hero in a book or movie, we wonder, “Why couldn’t  my  life be a hero’ s journey? ” </p></div>

The mathematics in those textbooks turned out to be a real terror—a baffling mishmash of Greek symbols, equations, and proofs.

<p class ="en"> Purpose shifts our focus from goals to the values that reside in our Inner Core. Goals are material outcomes that we either achieve or don’t—but values have no beginning or end. When we train ourselves to wake up every day committed to putting our values into action, our motivation and happiness start to come from knowing that we have done our best to express them in the conditions that unfolded that day—rather than from whether we got credit for our contributions, or concluded a deal, or launched a product. </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">

<p class ="en"> There is one problem with moving from goals to values. Goals create ambition, and ambition propels us toward achievement. Without goals, you would just sit around being kind and compassionate, but  with no drive to do something to change the world. You would be far removed from your full potential. That’s why we cannot afford to abandon goals. Steve Hayes, founder of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), has shown how instead of trying to  replace  goals with values, we can  derive  our goals  from  our values. At any point in time, you have certain resources available to you—physical, financial, social, intellectual. Set goals that maximally express your values given those available resources. Your goals can then be the outer markers of your strivings, the milestones that track your progress in the committed pursuit of your values. </p></div>

We regarded the struggle in prison as a microcosm of the struggle as a whole. We would fight inside as we had fought outside. The racism and repression were the same; I would simply have to ride on different terms.” </p></div>

Some years back, my family and I traveled to Robben Island to visit the prison where Mandela had been incarcerated for most of his twenty-seven years in captivity. During his incarceration, Mandela couldn’t tangibly pursue his larger ambitions for dismantling the system of apartheid outside prison, so he used his time there to dismantle the system of apartheid  in the prison . Black prisoners back then were only allowed to wear shorts, while other prisoners could wear trousers. Blacks were given fewer calories and less sugar than other inmates. Mandela organized protests that made prison authorities reform those practices. Being in prison allowed Mandela to pursue the same values, but through a modified set of goals. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Our external conditions are always changing, and often beyond our control. When we become attached to outer goals, we surrender control over our happiness to the whims of the world. Purpose anchors our motivation in the things we truly stand for, the values we hold deeply at our Core. Purpose liberates us from anxiety about whether our goals will be achieved, giving us the resilience to adapt to whatever headwinds we encounter. Goals can be scaled up, or down, or moved sideways, as our resources change, all in the service of the same Purpose. We are no longer dependent on outer conditions—on the conduct or approval of others, or on the cards that life deals to us on any given day—for our fulfillment. Each time we experience a breakthrough or a setback, we go back to our Core to reaffirm our values and then find the best way to reexpress them as goals, given our new conditions.

<p class ="en"> Katharine Graham was serving as a housewife in 1963 when her stirring came—not as an inner call but as an outer whack. That year, her husband died by suicide, leaving the family business, the  Washington Post , in her untutored hands. Women almost never took the helm of companies in those days, and most people expected her to sell the newspaper. But she had been stirred. “I cared so much about the paper and about keeping it in the family that, despite my lack of knowledge and feelings of insecurity, I felt I had to make it work.” She originally intended to keep a low profile. “I saw my job now as that of a silent partner, watching from the sidelines as I tried to learn about the company to which I had tragically fallen heir. I saw myself as a bridge to my children and viewed my role before they could take over as supporting the strong men.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Graham’s initial impulse may have been to take this on for her family, but events conspired to draw her toward a more selfless and visionary Purpose over time. Early in her tenure, she faced pressure from prominent politicians who were seeking the  Post ’s endorsement for electoral office. She politely declined their requests and began to see herself as a watchdog for a free and unbiased press. “I believe very deeply that we in control of news media have a solemn obligation.… I believed intuitively—and the feeling grew with experience—that the news columns had to be fair and detached, even while recognizing that there really is no such thing as ‘objectivity.’” When the Pentagon Papers were leaked to the press, she made a courageous call to approve their publication despite tremendous pressure from the Nixon White House. She once reflected, “[We] believed the [Pentagon] Papers were so useful to a greater understanding of the way in which America became involved in the Vietnam War that we regarded their publication not as a breach of the national security, as the administration claimed, but, rather, as a contribution to the national interest—indeed, as the obligation of a responsible newspaper.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> If you are thinking, “I have neither an outer push nor an inner pull. How do I get myself stirred?” then let me introduce you to my favorite stirring tool. When I was growing up, my family and I on rare occasions found ourselves driving past the local cremation ground. “Oh, look at the smoke!” I would say. “Someone is being cremated.” My mother would glance at me disapprovingly, keen to turn her children’s attention toward more pleasant subjects. That protective response from her is what most of us do every day. We shun death, hoping that it in turn will shun us. But the irony is that when we cultivate an active awareness of death, we become more alive—alive to the need to make every moment count, to the imperative of finding our true path and minimizing the detours, to doing the best we can  during our limited time on Earth, and to being true to our inner stirrings. Staying ever conscious of how death will someday lay claim to my body and how I will be required to instantly shed all my earthly roles, identities, and attachments has been an invaluable aid for me to staying actively stirred in a world that can otherwise dull our deeper hungers with its distractions and desires. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> At age ten, I started to frequent Yogananda’ s ashram in Ranchi, India . Each time I went there, I experienced a tiny but tangible tug. A feeling of purity swept over my consciousness and illuminated what was truly important. On one such visit, when I was seventeen, I found myself more intensely affected than ever before. Tears of joy flowed down my face after a group meditation. “Let me stay here,” I proposed, as my family prepared to return home. “You can go back. I want to figure out what I really want in life.” My parents listened patiently. To them, this sudden call from the cosmos was an unnecessary distraction from the practical goal of getting me to graduate from high school. They urged me to return home with the family. In that moment, I had neither the courage nor the discipline to act on my inner stirrings, so I capitulated. Within a few days, I was once again caught in the tangled web of life. It wasn’t until I was thirty-four—exactly twice that age—that I finally sought once more to do justice to the stirrings I had experienced so palpably in the ashram on my youthful visit. That was when I flew to Los Angeles to meet with Brother Arnold and discuss the new equation for my life. </p></div>

This prophecy did come to pass, for in 334 BC, twenty-two-year-old Alexander embarked on a series of conquests that, within eleven years, made him the ruler of an expanse of over two million square miles.

The quotes and narrative below come from the accounts of Megasthenes, a Greek historian who followed Alexander to India, and Palladius, the bishop of Helenopolis in the fourth century. “Upon arriving in Taxila in northern India, Alexander sent an emissary,  Onesikritos,  to fetch a great yogi of Taxila, Dandamis, from his forest retreat. ‘The son of the mighty God Zeus, being Alexander who is the Sovereign Lord of all men, asks you to go to him.

After all, if you were in Alexander’s shoes, possessed of legendary power, glory, and territory, gaining victory upon victory in violent battles, and you started to suspect that the real meaning of life lay elsewhere, would you have been able to walk away from it all? </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Just nineteen years after Alexander’s death, in the same India that he reluctantly abandoned, another conqueror was born. Ashoka, like Alexander, ascended to power as a young man by summarily executing other claimants to the throne. For the next eight years, he engaged in a series of wars to expand his kingdom, ultimately ruling over thirty million people across most of the Indian subcontinent. One day he witnessed the pain and suffering his army had inflicted in the war on Kalinga, in which over a hundred thousand people lost their lives. Deeply shaken, he asked himself, “What is my relationship with humanity? What are the duties of a king? What aspects of life have the most enduring significance?” He changed his ways to focus on serving his people and propagating spiritual and cultural wisdom through his “sermons in stone,” edicts carved into rocks, cave walls, and pillars located throughout the nation, some of which still survive. Rock Edict X “declares that a king’s true glory depends on the moral progress he aids his people in attaining.” Rock Edict XI defines “‘the true gift’ to be, not goods, but Good—the spreading of truth.” On Rock Edict VI, Ashoka “invites his subjects to confer with him on public business ‘at any hour of the day or night,’ adding that by faithful  discharge of his kingly duties he was thus ‘obtaining his own release from the debt he owed his fellowmen.’” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Values and principles are not all-or-nothing entities that you either have or don’t; they require continual refinement. One of my treasured values has been nonviolence. Early on, I translated this into the principle “Do not inflict pain on others.” This led me to give up meat when I was eleven, because “others” for me included animals. Then when I was fourteen, I read some of Gandhi’s writings. Nonviolence, Gandhi stated, is not only about what we do, but also about what we speak and what we think. Whenever we are unnecessarily critical or disrespectful of someone, that is an act of violence. I modified my principle to be “Do not inflict pain on others  in thought, speech, or action .” </p></div>

I recast my commitment to nonviolence  as “Do not inflict physical  or emotional  pain on others in thought, speech, or action.” At thirty-three, I had to revise it again. In running my startup, I found it necessary on occasion to give employees critical feedback, and even to fire people. I simply could not avoid inflicting emotional pain in those moments, because I had to do what was right for my organization. My principle now became “Do not inflict physical or emotional pain on others in thought, speech, or action,  except when it is necessary to do so in service of your Purpose .” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When I began studying great leaders from history, I saw how hard they worked in difficult moments to look for a nonviolent solution. And if they did have to take a path that would cause some pain, they tried their best to minimize the pain. They delivered tough messages to people in the most respectful and loving manner. They laid off employees only after they had sought out all reasonable alternatives, and when they did let someone go, they aimed to support them as best they could. They fought their enemies fiercely but also looked for every opportunity to build rapprochement, understanding, and win-win outcomes. I fell in love with this idea. It made the framework of nonviolence more compelling and more complete. I added the following clause to my principle: “ When you do have to inflict pain, do so only as an instrument of last resort, and minimize the pain needed to achieve your Purpose .” </p></div>

Thankfully, he was still there when I walked out at the end of the film. I went over to him and apologized. He broke into a smile as we affectionately shook hands.

If I simply do not have a choice and need to kill it, I make sure it is totally squished, so I don’t leave it half-dead, half-alive, in pain—and then I send a prayer to the universe for its departed soul.

You raise him as your own, with love and care. Your son’s school is quite dysfunctional, with a high crime rate, so in seventh grade, he insists that you put him in a different school. You and Clara spend all your savings and take out a big mortgage on a new home in a more affluent neighborhood so your son can go to a better school. One day you and your son are doing a woodworking project at home, and you notice that he has left things  unfinished: the fence he’s building isn’t painted on the back side.

<p class ="en"> Purpose can have a dark side. It can make us ignore our commitments to others, place unhealthy physical or mental strain on us, or usher in a future that brings not just the blessings we sought but  also harm we didn’t anticipate. That’s why it is important that we also pursue what I call UnPurpose: understanding the risks and costs associated with Purpose, and striving to undo them in our pursuit of Purpose. In masterminding the strategy for India’s civil disobedience against British rule, Gandhi did something quite peculiar. He developed a struggle-truce-struggle format in which any national program he launched went on for only a year or two before he called it off for several years. Other leaders objected, but Gandhi knew that people needed periods of rest in between their contributions to the movement. He saw the truces as opportunities for people not just to recharge but also to reform. India’s outer liberation from British rule was of no use to him if it wasn’t accompanied by India’s inner liberation from dark-age social practices. During the periods of rest, he challenged Indians to cultivate self-discipline and a spirit of selflessness, and to advance, among other causes, women’s rights, education, religious harmony, and the elimination of caste consciousness. It took him twenty-seven years to gain India’s freedom, but the years of rest and reform allowed the freedom struggle to stay strong during that period and prepared the country for more successful self-rule in the decades following independence. Among nations that won their freedom after World War II, India is a rare case of a stable democracy—and that, too, as a nation of 1.4 billion people with a variety of languages and religions. This stability has much to do with Gandhi’s decision to invest those twenty-seven years in pursuing not just his Purpose but also his UnPurpose. As with Gandhi, to serve our UnPurpose will require us to temper our Purpose, to sacrifice short-term gains in order to secure a more perfect long-term future. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Not at all. Because while you wait to find a vocation that fits your Purpose, you can meanwhile mold your Purpose to fit your vocation. In a study of janitors working at hospitals, scientists found that a few of them reported great fulfillment and joy from their work. “How,” you might ask, “do these people find janitorial work uplifting?” A typical janitor might describe their work as follows. “I arrive at eight a.m. I clean all the patient rooms, restrooms, and corridors on floors four and five. I take a break between noon and one p.m. I take out the trash sometime in the afternoon. Then I leave at five p.m.” But the janitors who reported satisfaction in their work “didn’t see themselves as custodial workers at all. One described forming such a bond with patients that she continued to write letters to some of them after they were discharged. Another paid attention to which patients seemed to have few visitors or none at all, and would make sure to double back to spend some time with them. Some, when asked what their jobs were, would say, ‘I’m an ambassador for the hospital’ or even, in one case, ‘I’m a healer. I create sterile spaces in the hospital. My role here is to do everything I can to promote the healing of the patients.’” </p></div>

She always takes a keen interest in people, and over the course of her janitorial career she has often developed a personal connection with executives whose offices she was cleaning. Several of them have turned to her for advice on their relationships at work and at home, because she is great at understanding people and their problems. In fact, I got the opportunity to  interview for this great job I am in right now after my mother reached out to an executive she had helped at my company!” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The BBC once profiled a Somalian immigrant who had fled tough conditions in his home country and immigrated to London. To make a living, he drove a taxi, though his heart was in journalism. In between rides, when his cab was free of passengers, he watched for police car sirens, and when he encountered one, he chased the vehicle to discover what was going on. Often he encountered newsworthy stories—a bar brawl gone wrong, a robbery, a bomb threat. He would excitedly call the local radio and TV stations to report the event. Over time, he developed a reputation in the local news community, and one of the organizations offered him a job. He crafted his role to beautify his job—and this eventually led him to a beautiful job! </p></div>

<p class ="en"> If your work isn’t fulfilling today, look for ways to pivot to a more Purpose-aligned vocation. But while you are still in your current role, remember that life’s remaining moments are fleeting and finite. Why let a year, a month, a week, or even a day go by without maximizing the fulfillment you experience by using role-crafting? And why not also apply role-crafting to all the roles you play at home, in tending to a child, cooking your dinner, or doing a chore? As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “No work is insignificant. All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence. If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep the streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep the streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause and say, ‘Here lived a great street-sweeper who did his job well.’” </p></div>

After being released from prison, Nelson Mandela wrote, “To survive in prison, one must develop ways to take satisfaction in one’s daily life. One can feel fulfilled by washing one’s clothes so that they are particularly clean, by sweeping a hallway so that it is empty of dust, by organizing one’s cell to conserve as much space as possible. The same pride one takes in more consequential tasks outside of prison one can find in doing small things inside prison.” </p></div>

To do full justice to your Purpose, you will want to look long and hard at how you spend your time, and take steps to simplify your life. Because when you find yourself pulled by a grand Purpose, the small tugs of daily distractions should be set aside. “It is not a daily increase,” Bruce Lee once said in describing a life well lived, “but a daily decrease. Hack away at the inessentials.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When he was thirty-one, Lincoln broke off his engagement to the same person he would eventually marry, Mary Todd. He then spiraled into depression: “I am now the most miserable man living.… I must die or be better, it appears to me.” He took shelter at the home of his friend Joshua Speed. “Lincoln went crazy,” Speed recalled.  “[I] had to remove razors from his room, take away all knives and other such dangerous things and it was terrible.” It was in this dark night of the soul that Lincoln discovered a powerful spark within. When Speed warned Lincoln that he would die unless he rallied, Lincoln replied that he could kill himself, that he was not afraid to die, but that he had “done nothing to make any human being remember that he had lived.” On another occasion, he remarked, “Oh how hard it is to die and leave one’s country no better than if one had never lived.” It is when we confront the prospect of death that we arrive at a full understanding of why we want to live. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在他31岁时，林肯与他最终要结婚的那个人玛丽-托德解除了婚约。然后他就陷入了抑郁症。"我现在是生活中最悲惨的人，....，在我看来，我必须死，否则就会好起来。"他在他的朋友约书亚-斯比德的家中避难。"斯比德回忆说，"林肯疯了。 "[我]不得不把剃刀从他的房间里拿出来，拿走所有的刀和其他此类危险的东西，这很可怕。"正是在这个灵魂的黑暗之夜，林肯发现了内心强大的火花。当斯比德警告林肯，如果他不振作起来，他就会死，林肯回答说，他可以自杀，他不怕死，但他 "没有做任何事情让任何人类记住他曾经活过"。在另一个场合，他说："哦，死后离开自己的国家，并不比从来没有活过好，这是多么难受的事情"。正是当我们面对死亡的前景时，我们才会充分理解我们为什么要活着。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> “I am naturally anti-slavery,” Lincoln once reflected. “If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I cannot remember when I did not so think, and feel.” White citizens at the time were divided on slavery. Lincoln’s friend Joshua Speed was a slaveholder, and Lincoln’s wife came from a slaveholding family. What made Lincoln hate slavery so viscerally? Perhaps it was because, as he once said, “I used to be a slave.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In Lincoln’s day, a child was required by law to be in their parents’ care and control until the age of twenty-one. Parents could legally require their children to work, and the children’s wages were the parents’ to keep. A  Newsweek  article reports, “Until he was 21 years old, Lincoln’s father had rented him out to neighbors in rural Indiana at a price of 10 to 31 cents a day, to labor as a rail splitter, farmhand, hog butcher and ferry operator. Thomas, his father, collected the son’s wages. Lincoln was in effect an indentured servant. He regarded his semi-literate father as domineering and himself without rights.” It was common for parents to use corporal punishment—whipping and beating—back then, and Thomas was said to sometimes use it on Abraham if he caught the boy reading when he was supposed to be doing chores, and for other acts of “impropriety.” Lincoln walked away from his father at age twenty-one, never to return; when in 1851 he received word that his father was dying, Lincoln wrote to his stepbrother, “Say to him that if we could meet now, it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful than pleasant.” His father’s behavior must have seared into Lincoln a lifelong  hunger to win freedom for others just as he had won his own. Perhaps the life experiences we go through are simply there to silently prepare us for our ultimate Purpose. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在林肯的时代，法律规定孩子在21岁之前必须由父母照顾和控制。父母可以合法地要求他们的孩子工作，而孩子的工资则由父母保管。 新闻周刊》 的一篇文章报道说："在林肯21岁之前，他的父亲以每天10至31美分的价格将他租给印第安纳州农村的邻居，从事铁路劈裂机、农场工人、生猪屠夫和渡船操作员的工作。他的父亲托马斯收取儿子的工资。林肯实际上是一个契约仆人。他认为他的半文盲父亲专横跋扈，自己没有权利"。在当时，父母使用体罚--鞭打和殴打是很常见的，据说如果托马斯发现亚伯拉罕在做家务时看书，以及其他 "不正当 "的行为，他有时会对他使用体罚。林肯在21岁时离开了他的父亲，再也没有回来；1851年，当他收到父亲即将去世的消息时，林肯给他的继兄写道："对他说，如果我们现在能见面，是否会比愉快更痛苦，这很值得怀疑。"他父亲的行为一定给林肯留下了终生的烙印， ，为他人赢得自由，就像他为自己赢得自由一样。也许我们所经历的生活经历只是为了默默地为我们的最终目的做准备。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Democracy was a young, fragile institution in the mid-nineteenth century. Lincoln realized that democracy was critical to the project of sustaining and strengthening personal freedoms. He also realized where power in a democracy lay. “Public sentiment is everything,” he once said. “With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently, he who molds public sentiment, goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions.” The United States, to Lincoln, was a nation where a grand experiment was underway to advance democracy. The success or failure of that test, he believed, would ripple across the world. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在19世纪中期，民主是一个年轻、脆弱的机构。林肯意识到，民主对于维持和加强个人自由的项目至关重要。他还意识到民主制度中的权力所在。他曾说："公众情绪就是一切"。他曾说："有了公众情绪，什么都不会失败；没有公众情绪，什么都不会成功。因此，塑造公众情绪的人，比制定法规或宣布决定的人更深入。"对林肯来说，美国是一个正在进行推进民主的重大试验的国家。他认为，这一试验的成功或失败将在全世界产生影响。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In his twenties, Lincoln witnessed a series of violent events carried out by enraged mobs at a time of rising tensions over slavery and race. The experience awoke in him a deep concern for the preservation of law and order. At twenty-eight, as a newly minted lawyer recently elected to the Illinois state legislature, he gave a speech in Springfield, Illinois, in which he said, “ [America ’s founding fathers] aspired to display before an admiring world, a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition… namely, the capability of a people to govern themselves.… Let reverence for the laws… become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.” This desire to protect the legal and constitutional fabric of the nation became a primal stirring in Lincoln. Having been a railsplitter, boatman, manual laborer, store clerk, soldier, store owner, election clerk, postmaster, and surveyor, he finally settled into a legal career, with some forays into politics. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在他20多岁的时候，林肯目睹了在奴隶制和种族问题日益紧张的时候，被激怒的暴民所实施的一系列暴力事件。这一经历唤起了他对维护法律和秩序的深切关注。28岁时，作为一名刚刚当选为伊利诺伊州立法机构的律师，他在伊利诺伊州的斯普林菲尔德发表了一次演讲，他说：" [美国 的建国者]希望在一个令人钦佩的世界面前展示一个命题的真理......即一个民族管理自己的能力。......让对法律的敬畏......成为国家的政治宗教；让所有性别、语言、肤色和条件的老人和年轻人、富人和穷人、坟墓和同性恋者，不断地在其祭坛上献祭。"这种保护国家的法律和宪法结构的愿望在林肯身上得到了原始的激发。他曾做过拼铁工、船工、体力劳动者、店员、士兵、店主、选举事务员、邮政局长和测量员，最后定居在法律职业中，也曾涉足过政治。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As a lawyer, Lincoln seems to have partitioned off his feelings about slavery from his fierce ambition to succeed in his profession. He was “not among those who… sought out cases involving blacks, or who volunteered to aid the antislavery cause.” In 1847, he even agreed to represent a Kentucky slaveholder, Robert Matson. Matson  had brought five enslaved people—a mother, Jane Bryant, and her four children—to Illinois, a free state, where they had asserted their independence. Matson contended that they still belonged to him and filed a case in court to win them back, hiring Lincoln as his lawyer. An antislavery activist, Dr. Hiram Rutherford, knowing of Lincoln’s critical views on slavery, approached Lincoln to propose that Lincoln represent the Bryants. “He listened attentively,” recalled Rutherford of his conversation with Lincoln, “but I noticed that a peculiarly troubled look came over his face now and then. His eyes appeared to be fixed in the distance beyond me and he shook his head several times as if debating with himself some question of grave import.” Something deep was likely stirred in Lincoln that day, for he quickly sought to switch sides so he could fight for the Bryants. Upon learning that Lincoln had initially agreed to represent Matson, Rutherford refused his help for the Bryants. Lincoln ultimately represented Matson. Accounts suggest that he put forth an uncharacteristically feeble argument in court and lost. Matson, enraged, left town without paying Lincoln his legal fees. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 作为一名律师，林肯似乎已经将他对奴隶制的感受与他在职业上取得成功的强烈野心分开了。他 "不属于那些......寻找涉及黑人的案件，或自愿帮助反奴隶制事业的人。"1847年，他甚至同意代表肯塔基州的一个奴隶主罗伯特-马特森。马特森 ，把五个被奴役的人--母亲简-布莱恩特和她的四个孩子带到了自由州伊利诺伊州，他们在那里宣称自己的独立。马特森认为他们仍然属于他，并向法院提起诉讼，希望将他们赢回来，他聘请了林肯作为他的律师。一位反奴隶制活动家海勒姆-卢瑟福博士知道林肯对奴隶制的批评意见后，找到林肯，提议由林肯代表布莱恩特。卢瑟福回忆起他与林肯的谈话时说："他听得很认真，""但我注意到，他的脸上不时浮现出一种特殊的不安的神情。他的眼睛似乎盯着我身后的远方，他摇了几次头，似乎在与自己辩论一些重要的问题。"那天，林肯内心深处可能有什么东西被激起了，因为他很快就想换个阵营，以便为布莱恩特人作战。当得知林肯最初同意代表马特森时，卢瑟福拒绝了他对布莱恩特的帮助。林肯最终代表了马特森。有说法称，他在法庭上提出了一个非同寻常的无力论据，结果输了。马特森被激怒了，没有支付林肯的诉讼费就离开了小镇。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In the years that followed, Lincoln began seeing a need to be more active in the public arena to contribute to the fight against slavery, worrying that “that spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself become extinct.” He contested a US Senate seat in 1854, but voluntarily surrendered his candidacy when he saw the antislavery vote being split between himself and another candidate, Lyman Trumbull, running the risk that the proslavery candidate would win instead. In 1858, he got a second opportunity to contest a Senate seat. Lincoln and his opponent, Stephen Douglas, had known each other since the 1830s, having engaged in nightly conversations around the fire in Joshua Speed’s general store back then. In 1856, when Douglas was already a prominent US senator, and Lincoln a largely failed politician, Lincoln had written a note to himself, not intended for others to read: “Twenty-two years ago Judge Douglas and I became acquainted. We were both young then; he a trifle younger than I. Even then, we were both ambitious.… With me, the race of  ambition has been a failure—a flat failure; with him, it has been a splendid success.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在随后的几年里，林肯开始看到有必要在公共舞台上更加积极地为反对奴隶制的斗争作出贡献，他担心 "那种希望和平消灭奴隶制的精神本身已经灭绝了"。1854年，他参加了美国参议院席位的竞争，但当他看到反奴隶制的选票在自己和另一位候选人莱曼-特伦布尔之间被分割时，他自愿放弃了自己的候选资格，冒着亲奴隶制的候选人反而会获胜的风险。1858年，他得到了第二次竞争参议院席位的机会。林肯和他的对手斯蒂芬-道格拉斯从19世纪30年代起就认识了，那时他们曾在约书亚-斯比德的杂货店里围着火堆进行夜谈。1856年，当道格拉斯已经是一位著名的美国参议员，而林肯基本上是一位失败的政治家时，林肯给自己写了一张纸条，并不打算让别人看。"22年前，道格拉斯法官和我结识了。那时我们都很年轻；他比我小一点。即使在那时，我们都是雄心勃勃的....，对我来说， ，野心的竞赛是失败的--平淡的失败；对他来说，它是一个辉煌的成功。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> During the 1858 Senate campaign, Douglas argued that America’s new territories in the West should be allowed to decide for themselves if they wished to allow slavery; Lincoln wanted to limit slavery to only the states where the Constitution already permitted it. Slavery was a strong institution at that time in the nation, and a source of great wealth. Douglas claimed that America’s founding fathers were open to slavery; Lincoln turned to a document older than the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence. He stated, “I think the authors of that notable instrument… did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development or social capacity. They defined [that men] were equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Calling the Declaration the “immortal emblem of Humanity,” he recognized that its promise was unrealized at the moment. “They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all: constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.” He saw it as a bold, sweeping vision for the whole world and for generations to come, “a beacon to guide” not only everyone in his time but “their children and their children’s children and the countless myriads who should inhabit the earth in other ages.” In our own pursuit of Purpose, we can inspire ourselves and others by defining an ideal vision of the future—our polestar—and then framing what we do as steps that move us closer to that standard. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在1858年的参议院竞选中，道格拉斯认为，美国在西部的新领土应被允许自行决定是否允许奴隶制；林肯希望将奴隶制限制在宪法已经允许的州。奴隶制在当时的美国是一个强大的制度，也是巨大财富的来源。道格拉斯声称，美国的开国元勋们对奴隶制持开放态度；林肯则转向了一份比宪法更早的文件，即《独立宣言》。他说："我认为那份著名文书的作者......并不是说所有的人在肤色、身材、智力、道德发展或社会能力方面都是平等的。他们规定[人]在某些不可剥夺的权利方面是平等的，其中包括生命、自由和对幸福的追求。"他称《宣言》是 "人类不朽的标志"，并承认其承诺目前尚未实现。"他们的意思是为自由社会建立一个所有人都熟悉的标准格言：不断期待，不断努力，即使从未完美实现，也不断接近，从而不断传播和深化其影响，增加世界各地各种肤色的所有人的幸福和生命价值。"他认为这是对整个世界和未来几代人的一个大胆的、全面的愿景，"是指导 "不仅是他那个时代的每个人，而且是 "他们的孩子和他们孩子的孩子以及其他时代居住在地球上的无数人的灯塔。"在我们自己对 "目的 "的追求中，我们可以通过定义一个理想的未来愿景--我们的北极星--来激励自己和他人，然后将我们所做的事情设定为使我们更接近这一标准的步骤。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A year after Lincoln’s loss, he received an invitation to speak from the Republican Party. Some party leaders feared that their leading candidate for president, William Seward, was too radical to win popular support, having suggested the use of extraconstitutional measures to fight slavery. Lincoln and a few other individuals were being engaged to speak so party officials could explore alternatives to Seward. Lincoln’s position was the same as Seward’s—that slavery should not be allowed to enter new states—but he wished to deliver a message that would land well on his listeners so he could win popular sentiment. He needed to honor the past while still embracing the future. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 林肯失利一年后，他收到了共和党的演讲邀请。一些党的领导人担心他们的主要总统候选人威廉-西华德过于激进，无法赢得民众的支持，因为他建议使用宪法外的措施来打击奴隶制。林肯和其他一些人被邀请发言，以便党的官员能够探索西华德的替代方案。林肯的立场与西华德相同--不应允许奴隶制进入新的州--但他希望传达一个能让听众满意的信息，这样他就能赢得民众的情绪。他需要在纪念过去的同时拥抱未来。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> His friend and biographer William Herndon later wrote, “No former effort in the line of speech-making had cost Lincoln so much time and thought as this one.” For weeks, he spent long hours at the state library to find historical records to help him prove that a majority of the signatories to the US Constitution were  against  slavery. He showed through their comments and voting records that they had accepted slavery to ensure that the colonies would come together to form the new nation, but they had hoped the nation would someday redeem itself of the institution. In his speech, delivered at Cooper Union in New York City, Lincoln proposed that by limiting slavery from spreading to new states, the citizens would therefore be  continuing  on the course set by the founding fathers—to bear with slavery where they couldn’t legally abolish it, but not to extend it. One audience member wrote, “When Lincoln rose to speak, I was greatly disappointed. He was… so angular and awkward that I had, for an instant, a feeling of pity for so ungainly a man.” But then, “his face lighted up as with an inward fire; the whole man was transfigured. I forgot his clothes, his personal appearance, and his individual peculiarities. Presently, forgetting myself, I was on my feet like the rest… cheering this wonderful man.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 他的朋友和传记作者威廉-赫恩顿后来写道："以前在做演讲的过程中，没有任何一项工作像这次一样花费了林肯这么多的时间和心血。"几个星期以来，他在州图书馆花了很长时间寻找历史记录，以帮助他证明美国宪法的大多数签署者是 反对 奴隶制的。他通过他们的评论和投票记录表明，他们接受奴隶制是为了确保各殖民地团结起来形成新的国家，但他们希望这个国家有朝一日能够赎回这一制度。林肯在纽约市库珀联盟的演讲中提出，通过限制奴隶制向新的州蔓延，公民将因此 继续 走开国元勋们设定的路线--在他们无法合法废除奴隶制的地方忍受奴隶制，但不扩大它。一位听众写道："当林肯站起来讲话时，我感到非常失望。他......那么有棱有角，那么笨拙，有那么一瞬间，我对这样一个不漂亮的人产生了一种怜悯之情。"但随后，"他的脸像被内在的火焰照亮了；整个人都变了样。我忘记了他的衣服，他的个人外表，以及他的个人特点。现在，我忘记了自己，像其他人一样站起来......为这个了不起的人欢呼。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Lincoln’s main opponent in the 1860 presidential race was, again, Stephen Douglas. This time, it was Lincoln who won—five years from the time he had considered himself a “flat failure” and Douglas a “splendid success.” Remarkably, Lincoln barely spoke in public between his Cooper Union address and his inaugural address as president, though privately he continued influencing and guiding his campaigners and supporters. In an emotionally charged atmosphere, Lincoln recognized that nothing he said would sway the views of his opponents, nor would it matter to his supporters. We, too, may benefit on occasion from putting our public pursuit of Purpose on pause because the conditions are not conducive, even while continuing to invest in it in private. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> America’s southern states fiercely disagreed with Lincoln’s position of not allowing slavery to expand into the nation’s western territories. With Lincoln as president, those states felt that they had lost all influence with the federal government, and the Civil War began. Overnight, the rules of the game changed for Lincoln: his Purpose would now hinge on how effective he would be not as a politician or an administrator, but as commander in chief of the military. His assistant secretary of war later recounted, “It was not so at the beginning; but after three or four years of constant practice in the science and art of war, he arrived at this extraordinary knowledge of it.… He knew human nature. He knew what chord to strike and was never afraid to strike it when he knew the time had arrived.” When we fuse with our Purpose, we acquire the drive to build whatever skills and play whatever roles are necessary to advance it. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Early in the Civil War, a Union army general issued, on his own, a proclamation to free all enslaved people in Missouri who belonged to enslavers who did not swear allegiance to the Union. Lincoln rescinded the general’s proclamation, fearing that it may make slave-holding border states like Missouri and Kentucky leave the Union for the Confederacy. Among those who roundly criticized Lincoln for this action was Frederick Douglass, a formerly enslaved  man who had escaped to the North, won his freedom, and dedicated himself to the abolition cause. Douglass announced that “the friends of freedom, the Union, and the Constitution, have been most basely betrayed.” Two years later, Douglass traveled to the White House to meet with Lincoln and shared certain concerns about the treatment of black soldiers in the war. He later recounted, “Mr. Lincoln listened with earnest attention and with very apparent sympathy, and replied to each point in his own peculiar, forcible way.” At the conclusion of their meeting, Douglass felt that “though I was not entirely satisfied with his views, I was so well satisfied with the man…” Even when we cannot immediately win over those who challenge our positions, we may find a way to engage with them that can warm their hearts and build mutual trust. </p></div>

His speech that day is remarkable for what it says, but even more so for what it doesn’t say. He honored the soldiers who sacrificed their lives to defend the idea that “all men are equal” and that “Government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.” Remarkably, he made no reference to who won or who lost, nor to the location or date of the battle. His focus lay beyond the horizon, on all people of all nations for all time to come.

<p class ="en"> Once, as president, Lincoln was considering a promotion for General Ulysses Grant after appreciating his performance in battle. Some advisors approached him to warn that Grant had a reputation for drinking too much. They expected Lincoln to reject Grant, especially since Lincoln himself was a teetotaler. Instead, Lincoln replied, “Ah! You surprise me, gentlemen. But can you tell me where he gets his whiskey? Because, if I can only find out, I will send a barrel of this wonderful whiskey to every soldier in the army.” Lincoln was differentiating between the public values he was committed to propagating  in the world and the private values he was committed to practicing on his own. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The further Lincoln progressed in his presidency, the fiercer his resolve became to abolish slavery. But the path to abolition was not clear. The only way to do so legally was for Congress to pass a constitutional amendment, for which there wasn’t adequate political support. Lincoln initially thought the best way to achieve this goal was the way it had been done by other nations in the Americas where slavery had existed: gradually, over several decades, with financial compensation being paid by the government to slaveholders for giving up their “property.” Two years into his term, Lincoln found a legal maneuver to more swiftly advance abolition. The law gave the federal government emergency powers to seize enemy property during war. Since the South after seceding had become an enemy of the nation, Lincoln drafted the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all enslaved people in rebel states to be free. He made clear to his cabinet that he wasn’t going to debate this move; his mind was made up. Members of his cabinet expressed a mixture of joy and concern. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 林肯在总统任期内走得越远，他废除奴隶制的决心就越强烈。但废除奴隶制的道路并不明确。在法律上废除奴隶制的唯一途径是由国会通过一项宪法修正案，但这并没有足够的政治支持。林肯最初认为，实现这一目标的最佳方式是美洲其他存在奴隶制的国家所采取的方式：在几十年内逐步实现，由政府向放弃 "财产 "的奴隶主支付经济补偿。上任两年后，林肯找到了一个法律手段来更迅速地推动废除奴隶制。该法赋予联邦政府在战争期间扣押敌人财产的紧急权力。由于分裂后的南方已成为国家的敌人，林肯起草了《解放宣言》，宣布叛乱州的所有被奴役者都是自由的。他向他的内阁明确表示，他不打算就这一举动进行辩论；他已经下定决心。他的内阁成员表达了一种混合的喜悦和担忧。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> William Seward—whom Lincoln had invited to join his cabinet even after running against him in the Republican primaries—was concerned that it would be a hollow gesture. The South had won all recent battles, so how would the proclamation have any material impact on the lives of enslaved people in the South if northern forces weren’t able to support them in their quest to act on their legally mandated freedom? Lincoln accepted Seward’s criticism, putting his plans on pause. He announced the proclamation weeks later, after the North had won a major victory in the Battle of Antietam. Like Lincoln, we may sometimes find ourselves pursuing the right action at the wrong time. Listening to dissenting voices and extracting the kernel of truth in their positions—without giving up our own principles—can help us refine and redefine our path to success. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 威廉-西华德（William Seward）--林肯在共和党初选中与他竞选后仍邀请他加入内阁--担心这将是一个空洞的姿态。南方在最近的所有战斗中都取得了胜利，因此，如果北方军队不能支持他们寻求法律规定的自由，那么公告对南方被奴役者的生活会有什么实质性影响呢？林肯接受了西华德的批评，暂停了他的计划。几周后，在北方在安提塔姆战役中取得重大胜利后，他宣布了该宣言。像林肯一样，我们有时会发现自己在错误的时间追求正确的行动。倾听不同的声音，从他们的立场中提取真理的内核--同时不放弃我们自己的原则--可以帮助我们完善和重新定义我们的成功之路。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Lincoln knew what he wished for—to create a world where all people had the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”—but he was not always correct about the steps to get there. His initial vision of a post–Civil War country was for formerly enslaved people  who had been freed to be settled in a colony abroad, and he directed government officials to make such preparations. Eventually, and after being roundly criticized by some for that plan, he recognized the rights of black people to become equal citizens of the United States. We may have a pure Purpose at our Core, but its outer expression will require continual learning and adapting on our part. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As Lincoln’s first presidential term drew to a close, Northerners were tiring of the war. Over six hundred thousand lives had been lost. The opposing Democratic Party promised to bring a rapid end to the war by negotiating peace with the Confederacy—the rebel states of the South. Republican leaders told Lincoln that public opinion had turned sharply against him, that “his re-election was an impossibility,” and that he needed urgently to end the war. Lincoln was persuaded to draft a letter to the Confederacy offering a truce, with no conditions attached. But deep within, the idea troubled him. Under such an agreement, the push to end slavery would be stalled, and even the enslaved people who had been freed under the Emancipation Proclamation would have to be returned to the former slaveholders. This would have set the country on an entirely different trajectory. The day after he wrote the letter, he changed his mind and did not send it, allowing the war to go on and accepting that all he could do was try his best to resolve it on the right terms while he was president, leaving the ultimate outcome in the hands of a higher power. He told a Republican party official, “I am a beaten man, unless we can have some great victory.” Two days later, the northern forces won a decisive battle in Atlanta. The direction of the Civil War turned sharply in the North’s favor, public sentiment moved back toward support for Lincoln, and he won reelection. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 随着林肯的第一个总统任期接近尾声，北方人对战争感到厌倦。超过60万人丧生。反对的民主党承诺通过与南方联盟--南方的叛乱州进行和平谈判，迅速结束战争。共和党领导人告诉林肯，公众舆论已经急剧转向反对他，"他的连任是不可能的"，他需要紧急结束战争。林肯被说服了，起草了一封给南方联盟的信，提出休战，不附带任何条件。但在内心深处，这个想法让他感到不安。在这样的协议下，结束奴隶制的努力将停滞不前，甚至根据《解放奴隶宣言》获得自由的被奴役者也必须归还前奴隶主。这将使国家走上一个完全不同的轨道。在他写完这封信的第二天，他改变了主意，没有寄出这封信，允许战争继续进行，并接受他所能做的就是在他担任总统期间尽力以正确的条件解决这个问题，把最终的结果留在更高的权力手中。他对一位共和党官员说："我是一个被打败的人，除非我们能取得一些伟大的胜利。"两天后，北方军队在亚特兰大赢得了一场决定性的战斗。内战的方向急剧转向对北方有利，公众情绪重新转向对林肯的支持，他也赢得了连任。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> With victory in the war appearing imminent, Lincoln wished at this stage to dissuade Northerners from feeling superior or vindictive toward their defeated fellow Americans. So he wielded the pen again to draft a speech for his second inauguration that would lay down the case for all Americans to approach this moment with grace and humility. He observed that both warring parties had claimed God to be on their side, and yet both parties had suffered huge losses. Thus,  he argued, both parties must in some way bear responsibility for the injustice of slavery for which the suffering in this war was a sort of “karmic” consequence. He was hinting at how even Northerners were complicit in the institution of slavery, having “promoted, prolonged, and profited” from it for a long time. He ended the speech with a stirring invitation to the American people to come together “with malice toward none, with charity for all,” to “bind up the nation’s wounds,” and “to do all which may achieve a just and lasting peace among ourselves and the rest of the world.” Later that day, he welcomed, among others, Frederick Douglass as a guest to the White House and asked what he thought about the speech. Douglass replied, “Mr. President, that was a sacred effort.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 由于战争的胜利似乎迫在眉睫，林肯希望在这个阶段劝阻北方人不要对他们的战败同胞产生优越感或报复心。因此，他再次挥笔为他的第二次就职典礼起草了一份演讲稿，为所有美国人以优雅和谦逊的态度对待这一时刻提出了理由。他指出，交战双方都声称上帝站在他们一边，但双方都遭受了巨大损失。因此， ，他认为，双方都必须以某种方式对奴隶制的不公正行为负责，而这场战争中的痛苦是一种 "因果 "的结果。他暗示，即使是北方人也是奴隶制的同谋，他们长期以来 "促进、延长并从奴隶制中获利"。在演讲的最后，他激动地邀请美国人民 "怀着对任何人的恶意，对所有人的善意 "走到一起，"医治国家的创伤"，并 "做一切可能在我们自己和世界其他地方实现公正和持久和平的事情。"当天晚些时候，他欢迎弗雷德里克-道格拉斯等人到白宫做客，并问他对演讲有何看法。道格拉斯回答说："总统先生，那是一种神圣的努力"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Lincoln by now viewed the law not as an end unto itself, as he’d done before, but as a means to an end—an instrument to be used for the greater goal of creating a more just world. He bent the law in carefully calculated ways, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, i  recognizing West Virginia as a new state without the constitutionally required permission of the parent state, Virginia, and declaring military rule in Kansas—all actions that the US Supreme Court later declared to be violations of the Constitution. As a Union victory in the Civil War became a near certainty, he made a push to finally bring an end to the institution of slavery, engaging in threats, lies, and bribes to secure votes among undecided members of the House of Representatives to pass a constitutional amendment that abolished slavery throughout the nation. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> At that crisis moment in my conversation with Rick about the future of Paramark, I was not open to reviewing the situation with fresh eyes, or to accepting the contrarian counsel of a caring mentor, or to reflecting objectively on my startup’s prospects. My intelligence was being hobbled by my intention. Research shows that when we make choices, our intellect does not act independently but in service of our intention: the desire we have for a certain outcome, a certain version of “truth,” shaped by our emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and attachments. When we are attached to an idea, our intelligence marches forth to prove that the idea is true and to protect and safeguard it from attack. It scans selectively for facts, arguments, and sources that support the idea, and it attacks the reliability of facts, arguments, and sources that challenge it. The more intelligent we are, the more adept we will be at marshaling arguments in service of our intention. A less intelligent person might, in the face of evidence that contradicts their objective, give up at some point and accept that they are wrong. But a more intelligent person will find inventive ways to challenge any data, argument, or expert that opposes their viewpoint. When we have a flawed intention, our intellect becomes our own worst enemy. Psychologists call this “myside bias.” </p></div>

Research shows that the higher your IQ, the more likely you are to believe you are not prone to such intelligence malfunctions; you believe that myside bias is for lesser intellects.

You stay stuck in a wrong groove, and your capacity to self-correct and grow your understanding is arrested. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We think we are free to make the best choices for ourselves, seldom realizing the silent but potent ways in which flawed intentions can fog our minds, loosen our grasp on truth, and skew our choices. A well-honed intelligence by itself is insufficient to lift this veil of delusion. To see through an accurate mental lens, our intentions must arise from our Inner Core, not our ego. For this, we need to  cultivate a hunger to uncover the truth in all matters, embrace it in whatever form it comes to us, abandon dearly held beliefs if they conflict with truth, and follow whatever trail truth wishes to take us down in the service of our Purpose. That is the essence of Wisdom. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> An ancient Indian epic, the Katha Upanishad, provides an apt metaphor for Wisdom. Think of your body as a chariot, of which you—your Inner Core—are the lord. You wish to move your chariot forward toward a meaningful destination. The horses—your emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and desires—are what give you energy to move the chariot forward. But left to themselves, one horse might get lazy and want to sit under a shady tree, while another might go wild and turn in the wrong direction. You need a charioteer to rein in and direct the horses. That charioteer is Wisdom. </p></div>

But this way of life is a fool’s paradise. In the long run, living based on limiting emotions and beliefs, and the behaviors they trigger in us, can damage our health, bedevil our mind, erode our performance, and compromise our relationships.

<p class ="en"> Anger, for example, is usually seen as a bad emotion, and with good reason. When you are caught in the grip of anger, you think, say, and do things you may later regret. You may strain and sometimes sever relations by engaging in disrespectful speech or behavior. Instead of building bridges, you destroy them. Your judgment is blurred and you make bad choices. Someone who does not have your best interests at heart may take advantage of your short fuse by deliberately riling you so you make the wrong move in an interview, negotiation, or competitive sport. Anger is infectious and mutually reinforcing. When you express it in a conversation, the other person may respond in kind, causing you to react with even more anger. At that point, it may be too late to turn the situation around—what was a spark is now a raging fire. Anger also negatively affects your health. People who have a high propensity for anger are at significantly greater risk of heart disease. And anger can sometimes keep you in its grip for hours and days after the initial trigger, distracting you from being mindfully engaged in your everyday moments; you nod your head politely to someone at work or a friend at dinner, but your mind is actually consumed with angry thoughts about an argument that happened at work that day. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 例如，愤怒通常被看作是一种不好的情绪，而且有充分的理由。当你被愤怒所控制时，你会想、说、做一些你后来可能会后悔的事情。你可能会因不尊重他人的言论或行为而使关系紧张，有时甚至断绝关系。你没有建立桥梁，而是破坏它们。你的判断力很模糊，你会做出错误的选择。一个不以你的利益为重的人可能会利用你的短处，故意激怒你，使你在面试、谈判或竞技运动中做出错误的举动。愤怒是有感染力的，而且是相互促进的。当你在谈话中表达愤怒时，对方可能会做出相应的反应，导致你做出更多的愤怒反应。在这一点上，要扭转局面可能已经太晚了--原来的火花现在变成了熊熊大火。愤怒也会对你的健康产生负面影响。有高度愤怒倾向的人，患心脏病的风险明显增大。愤怒有时会让你在最初触发后的数小时甚至数天内都无法自拔，使你无法全神贯注地投入到日常的生活中；你在工作中向某人或朋友在晚餐时礼貌地点头，但你的头脑实际上被那天在工作中发生的争执的愤怒想法所吞噬。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Yet anger can also be a force for good. It makes you wake up and pay attention to what is not right in our world. It gives you the motivation and energy to act. It causes you to lose your fear. It supports you as you rise above constraints and setbacks to keep fighting the good fight. It helps you galvanize people toward collective action on a righteous cause. When people see your anger, it can prompt them to take you seriously. Gandhi said, “As heat conserved is transmuted  into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power that can move the world.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 然而，愤怒也可以是一种善的力量。它使你醒来并注意到我们的世界上有什么不对。它给你行动的动力和能量。它使你失去恐惧。它支持你超越限制和挫折，继续为正义而战。它帮助你激励人们在正义的事业上采取集体行动。当人们看到你的愤怒，它可以促使他们认真对待你。甘地说："正如保存的热量被转化为 ，即使如此，我们控制的愤怒也可以转化为一种可以推动世界的力量。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Optimism is usually seen as a good emotion. It gives you motivation to work harder at your goal. It keeps you resilient in turbulent times. You are more creative, because you keep looking for new solutions. Optimism has been shown to drive success in education and in many professions. Visionary people have to be optimists, for visionaries are people who can see untapped possibilities where others see only boundaries and constraints. Optimists inspire others with their positive beliefs about the future, infect others with their positivity, and draw others to them. They are happier people and much less likely than pessimists to suffer from depression. Optimists are also physically healthier. Research studies that have tracked people over several decades have showed that optimism adds on average ten years to your life (relative to pessimism). </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 乐观通常被看作是一种好的情绪。它使你有动力为你的目标更加努力工作。它使你在动荡时期保持坚韧。你更有创造力，因为你不断寻找新的解决方案。乐观主义已被证明可以推动教育和许多职业的成功。有远见的人必须是乐观主义者，因为有远见的人能够看到未开发的可能性，而其他人只看到边界和限制。乐观主义者用他们对未来的积极信念激励他人，用他们的积极性感染他人，并吸引他人加入他们。他们是更快乐的人，比悲观主义者更不可能患抑郁症。乐观主义者的身体也更健康。几十年来对人们的跟踪研究表明，乐观主义平均能使你的寿命增加10年（相对于悲观主义而言）。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> But optimism can hurt you when it causes you to ignore possible scenarios that could go wrong. When you are optimistic, you may fail to take adequate preventive measures, or to formulate a plan B. To anticipate problem situations, it helps to view things through a pessimistic lens. Optimism can also fool you into making fatal miscalculations about the future, allow you to ignore simmering problems that over time become big and unresolvable, and lull you into underpreparing for high-stakes moments. Moreover, a leader who spouts unambiguously optimistic messages to the team—“We will win!”—at a time when all looks dark and gloomy can come across as unrealistic, even unhinged, and unworthy of the team’s trust. Sometimes the downside scenario you have ignored comes true, potentially killing your dream, and even killing you. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 但是，当乐观主义导致你忽视可能出错的情况时，它就会伤害你。当你乐观时，你可能无法采取足够的预防措施，或制定B计划。要预测问题的情况，通过悲观的视角看待问题是有帮助的。乐观主义也可能愚弄你，使你对未来作出致命的误判，让你忽视那些随着时间推移变得巨大而无法解决的隐患，并使你在高风险时刻准备不足。此外，当一切看起来都很黑暗和阴暗的时候，一个领导者向团队发出毫不含糊的乐观信息--"我们会赢的！"--会让人觉得不现实，甚至是不正常的，不值得团队信任。有时，你所忽视的不利情况会成真，有可能扼杀你的梦想，甚至扼杀你。 </p></div>

I’ve benefited from learning about the beautiful discipline of cognitive behavioral therapy from one of its preeminent exponents, Dr. David Burns of Stanford University; this section is largely based on his work. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> My feelings of frustration didn’t arise because Maria was disengaged, but because of the thoughts that her disengagement triggered in me: that my class was dull and irrelevant, or that she was academically unmotivated. These are ANTs—automatic negative thoughts. We experience them all the time. “This project is a disaster.” “Those people just don’t understand.” “It’s useless talking to him.” “She is so uncaring.” “I’ll never be able to do this right.” In situations where we experience ANTs, we depart from fact-based reasoning and fall prey to mental distortions. My favorite distortions are the following: </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我的挫败感并不是因为玛丽亚不参与，而是因为她的不参与引发了我的想法：我的课很枯燥，不相关，或者她在学术上没有动力。这些都是ANT--自动的消极想法。我们一直在经历它们。"这个项目是一场灾难"。"那些人就是不明白。""和他说话是没有用的。""她是如此无情。""我永远无法做好这件事。"在我们经历ANT的情况下，我们偏离了基于事实的推理，陷入了心理扭曲的困境。我最喜欢的歪曲有以下几种。 </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 五种常见的心理扭曲现象 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Mindreading:  When I thought, “My class is dull and irrelevant,” I was assuming that Maria was disengaged because she didn’t like the class. Mindreading happens when we assume we know what the other person is thinking or feeling. “I haven’t heard back from him. He must have not liked my proposal.” Mindreading can have a punishing impact on our interactions and relationships. And our digital age has made mindreading even more pervasive. You text someone, and now that it’s been twenty seconds and they haven’t texted you back, you think, “He doesn’t love me.” Ten minutes later he responds after coming out of a meeting, and now you are at peace—until your next mindreading crisis. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 读心术。 当我想："我的课很枯燥，无关紧要 "时，我就假设玛丽亚不喜欢这门课，所以她不愿意参与。当我们假设我们知道对方在想什么或感觉什么时，就会发生读心术。"我还没有收到他的回信。他一定是不喜欢我的提议"。读心术会对我们的互动和关系产生惩罚性影响。而我们的数字时代已经使读心术更加普遍了。你给某人发短信，现在已经过了20秒，他们还没有给你回短信，你想，"他不爱我。"十分钟后，他在开完会后回复了你，现在你心平气和了--直到你的下一次读心术危机。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Mental filtering:  Mental filtering makes you pay attention to a small set of observations and ignore all others. In entertaining the thought “My class is dull and irrelevant,” I was ignoring how engaged the  other  forty-three students were. You might focus on one critical comment someone made during a meeting, ignoring the positive comments others made, or on a few disappointing actions by someone you know, looking past all their positive contributions. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 心理过滤。心 理过滤使你注意一小部分观察，而忽略其他所有观察。在接受 "我的课很枯燥，不相关 "的想法时，我忽略了 其他 43名学生是如何参与的。你可能会关注某人在会议期间的一个批评意见，而忽略了其他人的积极意见，或者关注你认识的人的几个令人失望的行为，而忽略了他们所有的积极贡献。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Labeling:  When I called myself “incompetent” or described the situation as a “nightmare,” I was labeling—using dismissive words that caricature one’s thinking and feelings about situations and people. When your thoughts include words like “moron,” “disgusting,” “ridiculous,” “frustrating,” or “craving,” you’re likely labeling. These words carry a strong emotional punch, trapping us in an extreme view and restricting us from thinking more freely and objectively. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 贴标签。 当我称自己为 "无能 "或将情况描述为 "噩梦 "时，我是在贴标签--使用轻蔑的词语来讽刺一个人对情况和人的想法和感受。当你的想法包括像 "白痴"、"恶心"、"可笑"、"令人沮丧 "或 "渴望 "这样的词时，你很可能在贴标签。这些词带有强烈的情感冲击，把我们困在一个极端的观点中，限制了我们更自由和客观地思考。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Blame:  When I concluded that my class was no good, I was engaging in self-blame. When I concluded that Maria had no academic motivation, I was engaging in other-blame. In this mental distortion, you assign blame to yourself or to others, while the true cause for a problem may lie elsewhere, as it did in this case. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 责备。 当我得出结论说我的课不好的时候，我是在进行自我责备。当我得出结论说玛丽亚没有学术动力时，我是在进行其他的责备。在这种心理扭曲中，你把责任归咎于自己或他人，而问题的真正原因可能在于其他方面，就像本案例中的情况。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> All-or-nothing thinking:  In  Chapter 2  we encountered the research scientist Babette and her boss, Gordon. When Gordon told Babette that her paper was “rubbish,” his comment was motivated by his unhappiness with the quality of writing in the paper, and he was ignoring the strong research it reported on. He had fallen into the trap of all-or-nothing thinking, which causes us to view things in a polarized manner, as wholly good or wholly bad. Someone is either a hero or a zero. A certain choice is either perfect or totally flawed. Either your job is great, or it sucks. Either your subordinate is awesome, or they’re awful. In most cases, people and situations are more textured, and truth more nuanced. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 全有或全无的思维。 在 第二章 中，我们遇到了研究型科学家芭贝特和她的老板戈登。当戈登告诉芭贝特她的论文是 "垃圾 "时，他的评论是出于对论文写作质量的不满意，他忽略了论文所报告的强有力的研究。他落入了全有或全无思维的陷阱，这种思维使我们以一种两极化的方式看待事物，认为是完全的好或完全的坏。某人要么是英雄，要么是零。某种选择要么是完美的，要么是完全有缺陷的。你的工作要么是伟大的，要么是糟糕的。你的下属要么很棒，要么很糟糕。在大多数情况下，人和情况是更有质感的，真理也更有细微差别。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Distorted thoughts typically have a whiplash effect on our emotions, making us experience an unproductive dose of anger, anxiety, or other emotions. Our aim should be to replace these ill-conceived ANTs with thoughts that are more precise, logical, and fact based. When you find yourself getting consumed by ANTs, challenge your thinking through questions like “Am I mindreading here? Filtering? Blaming? Labeling? Engaging in all-or-nothing thinking?” “Is there good evidence to support the ANT’s claim?” “What additional evidence should I collect before reaching a conclusion?” “Could there be another explanation for this?” “Could the opposite of this also be true, and if so, what’s a more balanced view?” “Instead of calling it a ‘nightmare,’ could I call it ‘very troubling’?” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 扭曲的想法通常会对我们的情绪产生鞭打效应，使我们体验到无益的愤怒、焦虑或其他情绪。我们的目标应该是用更精确、更有逻辑性、更有事实依据的想法来取代这些错误的ANTs。当你发现自己被ANTs所吞噬时，通过诸如 "我是在读心吗？筛选？指责？贴标签？从事全有或全无的思考？""是否有很好的证据来支持ANT的主张？""在得出结论之前，我应该收集哪些额外的证据？""这可能有其他解释吗？""与此相反的情况也可能是真的，如果是这样，什么是更平衡的观点？""我可不可以不叫它'噩梦'，而叫它'非常麻烦'？" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I could have challenged myself with questions like these in the class that Maria was enrolled in. That would have helped me replace the ANT that said “My class is dull and irrelevant” with “Other students seem quite engaged, so something must be going on with Maria. I should check in with her to learn how she’s doing.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 我本可以在玛丽亚所上的课上用这样的问题来挑战自己。这将有助于我用 "其他学生看起来很投入，所以玛丽亚一定有什么事情发生 "来取代 "我的课很枯燥、不相关 "的ANT。我应该去看看她，了解她的情况"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Henry David Thoreau wrote, “As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To  make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.” Once you have a rescripted thought to replace an ANT, repeat the new thought whenever the ANT gets triggered. For it  will  get triggered, again and likely again. But with sufficient repetition, you will one day have a new thought-groove in your brain, and the old ANT-groove will dissolve away. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> An executive at one of my workshops, Rohan, described a powerful personal journey. A plant worker, Kamal, was to be given the Employee of the Year award at the annual holiday party of a production facility where Rohan was head of human resources. A few days before the event, which was to be a gala affair in the small town where the company resided, Kamal came to Rohan’s office, looking very anxious, asking that he not be made to speak in front of the group on the day of the event. Rohan was in a rush to get to a meeting, and he’d heard this concern before. He told Kamal, “Congratulations for this recognition you are receiving. Don’t worry. This happens every year. You are afraid of public speaking, isn’t that it? We’ll prepare a very short speech for you, and all you need to do is read it. You’ll be fine—trust me. Now I must go to meet with some executives on an important matter.” And then Rohan moved on. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> On the day of the event, Kamal did not show up. His employers later discovered that he had died by suicide that morning. He had been having an affair, and the woman he was involved with had wanted their relationship to become public, but he didn’t. When she learned of his impending award, she threatened to blow their cover by walking up to the stage when it was Kamal’s time to make a speech. That was the reason for Kamal’s anxiety, not a fear of public speaking. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Rohan had thought, “I  know  what’s on Kamal’s mind. He’ll be fine once we give him a script to read. I’m great at managing people issues, and I’ve got this one. This is a trivial issue.” These assumptions had prevented Rohan from pausing, inquiring, and discovering the true cause of Kamal’s discomfort. These weren’t negative thoughts—they were positive thoughts. And yet the thoughts contained distortions like mindreading, all-or-nothing thinking, and labeling. There is a  sobering lesson here for us all. When you feel highly confident, impatient, proud, powerful, or bold, take pause to see if you are engaging in any APTs—automatic positive thoughts—that may be clouding your mental lens. Use the same approach I’ve described with ANTs to challenge and rescript your APTs. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Ten years ago, I began to experience symptoms of poor health. I consulted with a doctor, then another, and then a third. All of them diagnosed in me the onset of a chronic disease that the National Institutes of Health calls “rare, progressive and irreversible.” They could not do anything about it, they said, besides prescribe me immunosuppressant drugs that would regrettably have a harsh effect on my immunity. I refused the medications and accepted my destiny. Every time I experienced ANTs (“This is terrible! This will destroy your life, your dreams, your everything!”), I countered them with more affirming thoughts (“I’m mostly OK. My inflammation will go away in an hour or two. I’m not dying”). </p></div>

<p class ="en"> On any given day, I, like you, have thousands of thoughts. Some of them I am proud of, some less so, and some are an outright embarrassment. Trying to figure out why unproductive words or thoughts arise will only take me down a rabbit hole. Perhaps a belief became ingrained in me through some childhood experiences. Perhaps I’ve inherited a certain way of speaking or thinking from my environment. Or perhaps the belief was in my DNA, based on habits of thought I’d acquired in lives past. Does it really matter? The important thing is for me to discern a good thought from a bad one, a fact-based one from a distorted one, an empowering one from a victimizing one. And so, moment by moment, I play the inner game of noting and regulating each thought as it comes. Those I wish to disown I allow to deflect off the surface of my consciousness. Most of these are legacy thoughts, habits of my past, and I do not wish to wallow in them. Those I wish to affirm I make my own, repeating them to myself and holding on to them like a loyal friend. And from those I have mixed feelings about, I extract the part that is true and untwist the part that is distorted, scripting an improved version of the thought that I then welcome into my inner chamber. Every time I resculpt such thoughts I am beautifying myself from within. </p></div>

A skirmish broke out on Punjab’s border with Pakistan, and, tragically, some Indian border guards were killed. The chief minister of Punjab i  faced great pressure to show that he was being decisive and taking responsibility. So he found a scapegoat in my father and demoted him to a lower rank in the police force. My father was devastated. He had played no role in the mishap and had been turned into a pawn in a larger political game. He was proud of having succeeded at making it into India’s elite civil service after much struggle in his early life; this career gave him an opportunity to grow beyond his family’s lower-class roots. And it was a primary reason my mother’s parents, who came from a much higher rung of the social ladder, had agreed to allow their daughter to marry him. The demotion, he believed, would shatter the family’s reputation. During that dark period, he returned home from work one day in a grave mood and announced to my mother, “The time has come. You need to prepare to live independently.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Why did my father decide on such a radical course of action? An event from the year 1947, when he was seventeen, may help us understand. That was the year India gained its independence from British rule and was partitioned into two separate nations. Millions of people migrated across the new border, religious tensions flared, and riots broke out. Hindus killed Muslims, Muslims killed Hindus, and over one million people died. My father’s family, who were Hindus, lived in a village located in what was going to become the Islamic state of Pakistan. They learned that a large crowd of Muslim rioters was closing in on their community, intent on raping and killing Hindus. To save the young women from the terrible fate they feared awaited them, the elders agreed that the young women should be killed right away. My father’s oldest sister was rushed to the rooftop and beheaded by her own uncle’s sword, as was his brother’s wife. Mercifully, before other women in the family could meet with the same fate, an escape route was forged. The family fled the village, made their way to India, and began life anew. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 为什么我父亲决定采取如此激进的行动？1947年他17岁时发生的一件事可能有助于我们理解。那一年，印度从英国统治下获得独立，并被分割成两个独立的国家。数以百万计的人跨越新的边界，宗教关系紧张，爆发了骚乱。印度教徒杀害穆斯林，穆斯林杀害印度教徒，超过一百万人死亡。我父亲的家庭是印度教徒，住在即将成为伊斯兰国家的巴基斯坦的一个村庄里。他们得知一大群穆斯林暴徒正在逼近他们的社区，打算强奸和杀害印度教徒。为了使这些年轻妇女免遭他们担心的可怕命运，长老们同意立即杀死这些年轻妇女。我父亲的大姐被冲到屋顶上，被她自己的叔叔用剑斩首，他哥哥的妻子也被斩首。令人欣慰的是，在家族中的其他妇女遭遇同样的命运之前，一条逃亡之路已经形成。这家人逃离了村庄，前往印度，开始了新的生活。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The family had decided to sacrifice their young women because they believed, as was the custom in their community, that death was preferable to dishonor. When my father resolved to shoot the chief minister and to accept the punishment that would come to him as a result, he was acting on the same belief, and on the belief that an attack on one’s honor must be met with a commensurately punitive response to save face. As luck would have it, the chief minister did not fire his would-be assassin. My father’s rage died down, and he found a more peaceful path to justice. He filed a legal petition to reverse his demotion on the grounds that he had not abandoned his duty. When the state high court dismissed his request, he appealed the decision to India’s supreme court. He could not afford the high fees of a supreme court lawyer, so he decided to learn the law and argue his case in India’s highest court by himself. This time, the court ruled in his favor, and he gained his rank and reputation—and with that, his life—back. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When we go beyond our emotions and thoughts to dig deeper in the soil of our consciousness, we eventually hit the hard rocks of our beliefs. Beliefs define the frame through which we perceive the world. They shape our thoughts, motivations, actions, and, ultimately, our lives. Wisdom invites us to choose our beliefs wisely, and to challenge and change those that are holding us back from seeing the fullest possibilities. Yet we seldom if ever consciously rescript our beliefs. We encountered this phenomenon earlier in the chapter: the idea of myside bias. When we hold a certain belief—“My partner is uncaring,” “This career is going nowhere,” “We need to make this investment”—we perceive the world through the lens of that belief. We pay attention to the facts that support our beliefs, ignore the ones that don’t, and take actions guided by the beliefs. </p></div>

He discovered that although cultural myths were quite varied in their outer form, they were very similar in their inner structure. Every myth contains a hero’s journey. The hero is enjoying an uneventful life until one day he is struck by adversity. At first, he seeks to tackle his challenges by seeking to change his circumstances, but that does not work. He then discovers, in his moment of greatest despair and often with  the guidance of an illuminated mentor, that what he really needs to change is himself. He experiences a big shift in his beliefs. A limiting belief is shattered; a new, empowered one takes root. He starts to think and act with Wisdom. Having accomplished this personal transformation, he is able to take on the challenge and emerge victorious. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> First, our inner voice may tell us, “You’re not winning because you’re approaching this the wrong way. You hold a limiting belief that you need to challenge.” This happened to me once when I was at McKinsey. I was working in the Chicago office, expecting to be staffed on a new engagement. A partner in New York offered to have me lead a digital marketing project for his client. I was keen to work on digital, so this was going to be ideal. But my staffing manager in Chicago, Sarah, wanted me to take on a different engagement with a home furnishings company. She pushed, then I pushed, and we paused. We picked up the conversation the next day, and the next, but neither of us was giving in. Then a senior director who had been an erstwhile champion for me took me aside to say, in effect, “Hitendra, fall in line.” I was quite shattered. McKinsey had told us when we were hired that we could “Make my own McKinsey.” And now I was being told to do Sarah’s bidding and give up on my digital dream! </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 首先，我们内心的声音可能会告诉我们："你没有赢，因为你的方式不对。你持有一个限制性的信念，你需要挑战。"我在麦肯锡工作时，曾经发生过这种情况。我当时在芝加哥办公室工作，期待着为一个新的项目配备人手。纽约的一位合伙人提出让我为他的客户领导一个数字营销项目。我很想从事数字工作，所以这将是一个理想的选择。但我在芝加哥的人事经理Sarah希望我接受一家家居用品公司的另一项业务。她催促我，然后我又催促她，我们就停了下来。第二天，我们又重新开始了谈话，但我们都没有让步。然后，一位一直支持我的高级主管把我拉到一边，说："希滕德拉，服从命令。我很受打击。麦肯锡在雇用我们时曾告诉我们，我们可以 "创造我自己的麦肯锡"。而现在，我却被告知要听从萨拉的命令，放弃我的数字梦想！我不知道该怎么办。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Much later, I recognized that the problem in that case wasn’t McKinsey’s broken promise; it was my limiting beliefs. I had believed that when two people clash, for one to win the other must lose, and I didn’t want to lose. But in fact, there is often a way to allow both people to win. I could have accepted Sarah’s request to take on the home furnishings project, and in turn asked for her commitment to find and staff me on a digital project in three months. My digital dream would have been deferred, not destroyed. I believed that the  firm owed me something because I was doing so well, rather than believing, more correctly, that there is always give-and-take—you do for the firm, and the firm does for you. In subsequent years, I’ve approached such situations with better beliefs, and they have helped me obtain better outcomes. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 很久以后，我认识到，在这种情况下，问题不在于麦肯锡违背承诺，而在于我的限制性信念。我曾认为，当两个人发生冲突时，一个人要赢，另一个人必须输，而我不想输。但事实上，往往有一种方法可以让两个人都赢。我本可以接受莎拉的要求，接手家居用品项目，反过来要求她承诺在三个月内为我找到一个数字项目并配备工作人员。我的数字梦想就会被推迟，而不是被摧毁。我相信 ，因为我做得很好，所以公司欠我什么，而不是更正确地相信，总是有付出和回报的--你为公司做，公司为你做。在随后的几年里，我以更好的信念来处理这种情况，它们帮助我获得了更好的结果。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Alternatively, our inner voice may tell us, “You brought this adversity upon yourself without knowing it, because you’ve got a flawed belief. Change this belief now so you and others may avert such difficulties in the future.” That’s what I learned from my health challenge. I had assumed I was living a healthy-enough lifestyle; that as long as I  looked  healthy, I  was  healthy; that having a chronic disease must simply come from bad luck, bad genes, or bad karma; that certain food products that promoted themselves as healthy, well, they must be healthy. The monk’s guidance, and my experience since, has made me rescript those views. I now believe that certain processed foods can slowly erode your health. I understand that a person may appear healthy from the outside even while certain lifestyle choices could be inflicting slow damage on vital body parts, showing up years later as chronic illness. I now recognize that chronic disease can in many cases be the body’s way of saying to us, “I’ve been doing the best I can for you, but it’s becoming increasingly hard, so I’m sending you this appeal. Take better care of me.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 或者，我们内心的声音可能会告诉我们："你在不知不觉中给自己带来了这种逆境，因为你有一个有缺陷的信念。现在就改变这个信念，这样你和其他人就可以在未来避免这样的困难。"这就是我从我的健康挑战中学到的东西。我曾以为我的生活方式足够健康；只要我 看起来 很健康，我就 很 健康；得了慢性病一定只是因为运气不好，基因不好，或者业力不好；某些宣传自己健康的食品，嗯，它们一定很健康。僧人的指导和我此后的经历使我重新审视这些观点。我现在相信，某些加工食品会慢慢侵蚀你的健康。我明白，一个人从外表上看可能是健康的，即使某些生活方式的选择可能对身体的重要部位造成缓慢的损害，多年后显示为慢性疾病。我现在认识到，在许多情况下，慢性病可能是身体对我们说："我一直在为你做最好的事情，但它变得越来越难，所以我向你发出这个呼吁。请更好地照顾我"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> A third scenario is that our inner voice may say, “You are suffering because you believe there’s nothing redemptive about the experience you are going through. You will be at peace once you accept your situation and translate the pain you’re struggling with into a noble, uplifting purpose.” By the age of thirty-six, V. R. Ferose was leading a five-thousand-person group at SAP and winning leadership awards. The world was his oyster. Then his eighteen-month-old son, Vivaan, was diagnosed with autism, and his world came crashing down. A mentor told him, “You are fortunate, Ferose. Most people need to find their purpose. In your case, your purpose has found you.” It was a turning point. His wife, Deepali, and he decided that for a period of time she would prepare Vivaan for the world, while he would prepare the world  for Vivaan. Ferose started an initiative within SAP to hire people with autism, demonstrating that although they may lack social skills, they may be especially talented at certain focused, repetitive, attention-to-detail tasks such as software testing. His success culminated in the company’s co-CEO committing to hiring 1 percent of their workforce from among people with autism. Ferose has since launched a number of global initiatives to create opportunities for people with disabilities, including an inclusion summit and an inclusion fellowship. His work continues to inspire many to forge their own path to finding meaning out of disability. Ferose’s transformation began with him accepting his situation and then channeling his pain into a cause that had deep meaning for him. As Viktor Frankl, a renowned psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor, wrote, “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We have been brought up in the world of binary logic. If something is true, its opposite must be false. Yet scientists in the twentieth century discovered that this was too limiting a framework. Mathematicians developed new forms of logic where statement A and its opposite, not-A, could both be true, and quantum physicists posited that electrons were both waves and particles. In formulating our beliefs, we, too, can benefit from fusing opposing ideas to arrive at higher, more integrative truths. F.

<p class ="en"> Consider my belief in reincarnation. The opposite belief would be that there is only one life. In my twenties, I ignored this opposite perspective, and I became relaxed and complacent about my own growth. I felt content, recognizing that I had plenty of this-life and future-life opportunities to get serious about serving the world and pursuing Self-Realization. In my early thirties, I finally acknowledged to myself that I was squandering the unique opportunity this life was giving me to maximize my growth and pursue an ennobling purpose. By fusing opposites, I emerged with a new belief: “I will have repeated chances in this and future lives to reach my full potential,  and yet  this life affords me an irreplaceable opportunity, right here, today, in this role I am playing as ‘Hitendra,’ to grow and to serve, a possibility that will never come back in this form.” This new belief has helped me infuse greater significance into each passing day. </p></div>

The belief in reincarnation may help you to avoid seeing any personal flaw or fumble as permanent, because each life offers a fresh opportunity to die to past transgressions and pains and move closer to your Inner Core. You may find this to be an attractive idea to cultivate even in the confines of a single life—the chance to feel untethered to your failings, to be open to lifelong reinvention in pursuit of your full potential, and to awaken each day as though you have died to yesterday and gained a fresh lease on life, a chance to lead it in the way that will make you proud.

<p class ="en"> Science today is showing what these great ones have always known: that when we are nonattached to the outcome of our actions, we make wiser choices in our pursuit of success. We free our mind to do its best work, undistracted by anxiety about our performance, what the score is, and whether we’re going to win or lose. We don’t feel the need to keep showing that we’re smart by playing to our strengths all the time; instead, we remain willing to open ourselves to new learnings, experimentation, practice, and growth. We focus on refining and improving those actions we can control while making peace with the fact that the outcome may ultimately be influenced by factors beyond our control. When the odds of success are low, which  they sometimes are in any heroic pursuit, we do not feel demoralized, nor do we quit, because we’re pursuing a noble goal, as Gandhi said, “without fear of failure and without hope for success.” We are comfortable taking an unpopular stand, for our nonattachment makes us immune to others’ praise and criticism, allowing us to pursue whatever ideas our Wisdom guides us to. We are not limited by a particular definition of success, or a particular path to it, and so as conditions change, we are able to pivot with agility. By surrendering our attachments, we are no longer trapped in a blind, possessive love of our own ideas, habits, or beliefs. We open ourselves to voices that are different from our own, and thus we keep learning and growing. </p></div>

Take a deep interest in the other party and in the rich possibilities that exist in what they and you could do together, but also know that they can have a rewarding future with or without you, and you can have a rewarding future with or without them.

Viktor Frankl wrote, “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.… Listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge.

I flew to the Bay Area to interview with two consulting firms, Decision Focus, Inc. (DFI), and Applied Decision Analysis (ADA). I was fortunate to receive job offers from both.

But somehow, each time I was about to call DFI to say “I accept,” I stopped in my tracks, feeling a pang of regret about having to say no to ADA. After two days of soul-searching, I decided to override my intellect and accept the offer from ADA—because I just couldn’t imagine missing out on the opportunity to work there.

I’d never worked at any company before, and so I hadn’t realized how much this human dimension would matter to  me or how organizations can be quite varied in this regard.

<p class ="en"> Intellect takes time and effort, consciously breaking a problem into parts and then attending to each separately. In contrast, intuition looks at a problem in totality, tapping not just our conscious but also our subconscious mind, making unexpected connections, helping us approach things from a new perspective, and drawing from all life experiences—automatically, instantly, and effortlessly. Intuition can alert us to a risk we were ignoring, offer a creative idea, suggest a promising new direction, or reassure us about the rightness of a choice. It often arises more as a feeling than as words. Einstein observed, “Words and language… do not seem to play any part in my thought process,” and “I believe in intuitions and inspirations.

<p class ="cn"> 智力需要时间和努力，有意识地将一个问题分成几个部分，然后分别处理。相比之下，直觉从整体上看问题，不仅挖掘我们的意识，也挖掘我们的潜意识，建立意想不到的联系，帮助我们从一个新的角度来处理问题，并从所有的生活经验中汲取营养--自动地、即时地、毫不费力地。直觉可以提醒我们注意我们所忽视的风险，提供一个创造性的想法，建议一个有希望的新方向，或者让我们确信一个选择的正确性。它往往更像是一种感觉，而不是语言。爱因斯坦说："文字和语言......似乎在我的思维过程中不起任何作用"，以及 "我相信直觉和灵感。我有时觉得我是对的。我不知道我是对的"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> You might say, “But wait. There have been times when I have trusted my gut or followed my heart only to discover later that I went down the wrong path. How do I know if I can trust my intuition?” These moments do not signify a failure of intuition, but a misapplication. What we take to be our intuition can at times be a misguided urge triggered by an emotional attachment, a bias, a limiting belief, or an ill-informed hunch that did not view a situation in totality. Intuition can be an indispensable aid, but only when it arises from a calm mind and partners with an active intellect. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Early in my ADA career, I was frequently dazzled at the speed with which senior partners would sometimes cut to the core of an analytics issue facing the client. “These partners are geniuses,” I would think. Later I realized they were mere mortals like me; they had just developed expert intuition, having worked over the years on several similar situations for other clients. Expert intuition works in contexts where we have acquired mastery through learning, reflection, practice, and feedback. Our brain gets programmed with an if-then pattern-recognition system and is able to, rapidly and subconsciously, assess situations and guide us to the most effective responses. Although our responses may appear effortless from the outside, behind them are the years of hard work and learning that went into wiring our brain that way. Expert intuition helps us discover hidden dimensions, factors we may have missed paying conscious attention to that can give us a quick and accurate read of a situation. </p></div>

In that stillness, as I meditated, a veil was lifted from my mind, and a new insight arose: “If you want to uncover your father’s true impact on you, focus not on what he preached—focus on what he practiced.” Flashes from the past raced through my mind: the grace with which my father managed his grief when his mother passed away; the moral strength with which he, as a police officer, took actions against criminals who sent him death threats; the frugal lifestyle that led to his toothbrush and razor blade becoming worn out with overuse so he could save money and secure his family’s financial future; the deep love he had for the creative force in the universe in the form of Divine Mother; the uncompromising discipline with which he performed his daily meditation; the indefatigable spirit with which he helped friends and strangers every day; the fierce resolve with which he took on causes to right certain wrongs. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Our brain has acquired a vast library of knowledge, everything we’ve experienced over the course of our life. Some of it we have conscious access to, but much of it lies hidden from view in our subconscious. Our brain compartmentalizes and organizes the material into different sections, and when we are solving a problem we go looking for an answer in the conscious part of our mind, and only from the section we believe the problem belongs to. This kind of rational thinking can be very limiting when we face critical or complex  dilemmas because it hides what lies beyond our conscious mind and doesn’t make us draw connections across different segments of our internal knowledge-library to uncover the most effective insights. What we need in those moments is to activate creative intuition. This form of intuition makes connections across disparate areas, scanning the full breadth of all we’ve experienced and learned, even things that may be lost to conscious memory, to allow novel ideas to emerge. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> One such “negative feature” Mandela sought to overcome was his temper. A prison official, Lieutenant Prins, said something offensive about Mandela’s wife, Winnie. Enraged, Mandela came close to physically assaulting the man, but just in time he switched instead to a verbal attack. He returned to his cell that day and thought, “Even though I had silenced Prins, he had caused me to violate my self-control and I consider that a defeat at the hands of my opponent.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Mandela opened himself up while incarcerated to reexamining his beliefs. The inmates watched a documentary on the Hells Angels, a controversial American motorcycle club accused of criminal activity. After the film, the inmates criticized the Hells Angels for their lawless ways. But a young prisoner, Strini, challenged his fellow inmates and expressed his support for the bikers for rebelling against the authorities. Emotions were roused, and several longer-tenured prisoners denounced Strini. Mandela had quietly been observing the inmates’ reactions, and he stepped in. “I considered what Strini said, and while I did not agree with him, I came to his defense.… I was not interested in the Hells Angels, but the larger question that concerned me was whether we had… been stuck in a mind-set that was no longer revolutionary. We had been in prison for more than fifteen years; the world that we left was long gone.… The movie reminded me once again that on the day I did walk out of prison, I did not want to appear to be a political fossil from an age long past.” Two Wisdom actions are in display in this story—looking for the truth  in your opponent’s position even when you disagree with them, and stepping back from small debates to take a metaview. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Mandela said, “I like friends who have independent minds because they tend to make you see problems from all angles.” Having diligently sharpened the axe of his thinking and his beliefs, he arrived at a state of Gandhi-like authenticity where what he felt, thought, spoke, and did were the same. A fellow inmate, Neville Alexander, remarked, “He thinks things through very carefully, and then the force and the power of his conviction makes him spontaneous. He is genuine, but it’s because it’s been thought through very, very carefully.” Patti Waldmeir, a  Financial Times  correspondent, described how, when she asked Mandela a question, he would be quiet for a while, then speak “when reason had extinguished passion in his breast.… There are no cheap glimpses into Mandela’s soul. He is too disciplined for that.” This is perhaps the simplest and yet most pivotal of all Wisdom actions: to hit pause, to refrain from speaking or acting until one has clarity over one’s thoughts and command over one’s impulses. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Over time, Mandela became less bitter and more purposeful about his dealings with the ruling white minority in South Africa, the Afrikaners. “Our emotion said, ‘The white minority is an enemy. We must never talk to them.’ But our brain said, ‘If you don’t talk to this man, your country will go up in flames.… And for many years to come… this country will be engulfed in rivers of blood.’ So, we had to reconcile that conflict. And our talking to the enemy was the result of the domination of the brain over emotions.” Mac Maharaj, another person incarcerated with Mandela, recounts, “He said to me, Mac… if you don’t know your opposite, how are you going to get them to respond the way you want?… ‘What must I do?’ I ask. He says, ‘Learn the language.’ ‘OK,’ I said, ‘I’ll learn.’ He says, ‘No, learn their poetry, understand their culture.” And that is what Mandela did, having realized, as he said, that “you don’t address their brains. You address their hearts.” </p></div>

Mandela wanted a hot plate on which to heat food in his prison cell after hours, something that required Van Sittert’s approval. Mandela peppered prison guards with questions to discover that the major was a “rugby nut.” So he learned all he could about the game. When the major came by next, Mandela greeted him with a big smile and started to talk about rugby—which players were doing well and which were performing poorly, and so on. Van Sittert was instantly engaged. After an animated discussion, Mandela explained why he wanted a hot plate and asked the major to arrange one for him because he was sure this was a problem the major would not want another rugby man to endure. Without hesitating, Van Sittert turned to a prison guard and asked him to get Mandela a hot plate. Instead of arming himself with guerilla gear, Mandela was now learning to disarm his opponents with Wisdom. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Benjamin Pogrund, a South African journalist, recalls, “Despite the lack of contact, word was coming out of Robben Island that Mandela was assuming a new stature. Released prisoners reported that he had become the acknowledged leader of all the political prisoners; that not only the ANC, but also Pan Africanist Congress members, the African Resistance Movement and others respected him and accepted his authority. He was the wise man who adjudicated in disputes.” This evolution in Mandela did not escape the notice of South Africa’s government. The situation in the country was deteriorating fast; protests against apartheid had intensified, the apartheid government had declared a state of emergency, the army and police had been deployed to fight the African National Congress, and violence had escalated. President Botha sent emissaries, including Niël Barnard, the head of the South African National Intelligence Service, to start a dialog with Mandela. John Carlin, in his book  Invictus , reports on what happened next. Barnard was “seen  as a dark and demonic figure [who] had waged a war on Mandela’s ANC.” But he was charmed by Mandela, later reflecting that he “is one of those strange individuals who captivates you.… You find yourself wanting to listen to him.” At a time when the oppressed black community’s rage was ripping through the nation, Mandela’s growing sensitivity and statesmanship made the government see him as their first and last hope for a peaceful future. Barnard recounted, “There was, in our minds… never the slightest doubt. This is the man—if you cannot find a settlement with him, any settlement will be out.” </p></div>

Barnard counseled Mandela to focus his conversation with Botha on easy topics, and warned him that if he asked for the release of Walter Sisulu, a fellow ANC leader who had been in prison for twenty-five years on milder charges, “Mr. Botha will say no. I know him.” Mandela prepared for the meeting “like an actor about to go onstage.… [He] read over the notes he had been preparing for several days, rehearsed his lines, played himself into the role.” Prepare.

Botha was moved; both his father and grandfather had fought in those battles. Through his actions, Mandela was having a silent  inner  conversation with Botha, helping him rescript his ANTs about Mandela and the black South Africans into thoughts like “Mandela is not my enemy.” “He actually likes us Afrikaners.” “What the blacks are seeking is just what we Afrikaners sought years ago.” Sensing that this was his moment, Mandela let his intuition override Barnard’s advice by directly asking Botha to release Sisulu.

Mandela had just returned from a foreign visit to face these media headlines on the government’s spin. He castigated the report and made critical remarks about Goldstone. Then at three o’clock that day, Goldstone’s phone rang. It was Mandela. “I’m calling you for two reasons,” he said. “The first is to tell you that I did a terrible thing, I commented and I criticized your report without having read it. I relied on media reports.… That’s the first reason I’m calling, to apologize. I should have never relied on the media, I should have read your report.

He continued to employ simple, and at times symbolic, actions to dispel limiting thoughts and beliefs among South Africans about the irreparability of their racial divide. As president of South Africa’s first democratic government, he actively supported the country’s rugby team in the World Cup tournament that took place in South Africa in 1995—even though the sport, which had no black players, had been a strong symbol of apartheid in the past. He developed a solid rapport with the team’s captain and attended the final match to cheer his country’s team. When they achieved an upset victory, Mandela strode into the stadium wearing the green jersey and cap of the team, a powerful gesture of reconciliation.

He received a guitar as a gift when he was ten, though he had hoped to get something different, perhaps a rifle or a bicycle. “I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.” He was regarded as a loner in school. His music teacher in eighth grade told him he had no aptitude for singing. He received no formal music training and studied and played by ear. In his senior year, he entered a talent show. “It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.” From then on, his star kept rising. By twenty-one, he was the most popular entertainer in America, attracting a record 82.6 percent of the TV viewing audience to his performance on  The Ed Sullivan Show , releasing a top-selling album, and revolutionizing America’s youth culture. He remains the best-selling solo music artist of all time. Forty years after his passing, the house where he lived is second  only to the White House in the number of visitors it attracts—half a million annually. I am of course talking about none other than the King of Rock ’n’ Roll, Elvis Presley. </p></div>

When they arrive at the summit to claim victory, we look back at their roots and are in awe about how much growth they have achieved. And yet this single-minded devotion to the mastery of their discipline has led many legends to very dark places: depression, loneliness, a struggle to be happy. In 1976, a cleaner at a Hilton hotel found notes that Elvis had scribbled to himself. “I feel so alone now.… I wish there was someone who I could trust and talk to.” In a letter he wrote to a friend in 1977, he said, “I need a long rest. I’m sick and tired of my life.… My willpower is almost gone.” Seven months later, at age forty-two, Elvis was dead, his body ravaged by a poor diet and an addiction to prescription drugs. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> There was a single purpose behind all that Steve Jobs did. “The goal is not to be the richest man in the cemetery,” he stated. “In the broadest sense, the goal is to seek enlightenment—however you define it.” So Steve made a trip to India when he was nineteen to meet with a saint he was inspired by, only to find that the saint had recently passed away. He absorbed the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism, visited Buddhist temples in Kyoto, took training from a Zen master, learned to meditate, and adopted a highly disciplined diet. For a brief period, he even contemplated walking away from modern life to become a Hindu ascetic, but then realized that his calling lay in the world. He wanted to “put a dent in the universe” by taking “computers and society, [which were] out on a first date,” and making “the romance blossom.” </p></div>

People have described Jobs during this period as callous, tempestuous, domineering, self-centered, and condescending. He ignored others’ ideas, was blind to market realities, pushed people too hard, and held on to grudges. Most egregiously, he refused to accept paternity of his daughter, Lisa, by a former girlfriend. After the success of the Apple II home computer, his next two major product initiatives, the Apple III and the Macintosh, were commercial failures, and he was forced out of Apple by the CEO and the board of directors in 1985. “At 30, I was out,” he later recalled. “And very publicly out.

<p class ="cn"> 1890年，甘地在伦敦学习了三年法律并通过了律师考试后，启程前往印度。他的船在风暴中抵达孟买港。甘地回忆说："对我来说，外面的风暴是内心的象征"。作为一个22岁的年轻人，甘地与不足和恐惧的感觉作斗争。他对真实自我的探索已经开始，但离完成还有很长的路要走。在他到达后不久，他被朋友Mehta博士介绍给Raychand，一个诗人和一个钻石商人。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Gandhi noted how much Raychand excelled at business. “[His] commercial transactions covered hundreds of thousands. He was a connoisseur of pearls and diamonds. No knotty business problem was too difficult for him.” But even more so, Gandhi was deeply struck by how Raychand exuded serenity amidst whatever circumstance came his way. “I never saw him lose his state of equipoise.… There was a strange power in his eyes; they were extremely bright and free from any sign of impatience or anxiety. They bespoke single-minded attention.… He looked an embodiment of peace. There was such a sweetness in his voice that one simply wanted to go on listening to him. His face was smiling and cheerful; it shone with the light of inner joy. He had such command of language that I do not remember his ever pausing for a word to express his thoughts.” He also wrote, “The thing that… cast its spell over me… was… his burning passion for self-realization. I saw later that this… was the only thing for which he lived.” Years later Gandhi recalled, “I must say that no one else has ever made on me the impression that [Raychand] did. His words went straight home to me.… In my moments of spiritual crisis… he was my refuge.… It is from [his] life that I have learnt the most. Such was the man who captivated my heart… as no other man has till now.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 甘地注意到Raychand在商业方面是多么的出色。"[他的]商业交易涉及数十万。他是珍珠和钻石的鉴赏家。对他来说，任何棘手的商业问题都不难解决"。但更重要的是，甘地被雷昌德在任何情况下都散发着宁静的气息所深深震撼。"我从未见过他失去平衡的状态....，他的眼睛里有一种奇怪的力量；它们非常明亮，没有任何不耐烦或焦虑的迹象。它们显示出一心一意的关注....，他看上去是和平的化身。他的声音是如此的甜美，让人只想继续听下去。他的脸是微笑和欢快的；它闪耀着内心喜悦的光芒。他的语言能力很强，我不记得他曾为表达自己的想法而停顿过一个字。他还写道："......对我有魔力的是......他对自我实现的强烈热情。我后来看到，这......是他活着的唯一目的"。多年后，甘地回忆说："我必须说，没有人给我留下过像[雷昌德]那样的印象。他的话语直达我的内心....，在我精神危机的时刻......他是我的避难所....，从[他]的生活中我学到的东西最多。就是这样一个人，吸引了我的心......直到现在也没有其他人能做到。" </p></div>

The more tangibly we can see our highest potential, the more we will burn with the fire required to get there. You need not restrict yourself to people you know personally, or people from your community, your profession,  or your era. When I was nine, I discovered Buddha, my first Core role model. I added others over time—Yogananda, Jesus, Saint Francis, Vivekananda, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Lincoln, and certain monks and nuns I’ve known.

<p class ="en"> First, the new science shows that you and I are dynamic, ever-unfolding beings. Who we are today is not who we are destined to be  tomorrow. In large part, our ability to grow is influenced by our mindset. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe their traits are mostly static—resist stepping out of their comfort zones to learn new skills, focus on seeing other people’s weaknesses rather than their strengths, experience feedback or criticism as a judgment on them rather than an opportunity to learn, and see failure as a sign that they don’t have any talent in a given area. In contrast, people with a growth mindset—those who believe their traits are malleable—enjoy learning new skills, gain inspiration from others’ strengths, actively learn from feedback and criticism, and use failure as a chance to learn, work harder, and up their game. Consequently, people with a growth mindset end up progressing while those with a fixed mindset do not. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 首先，新的科学表明，你和我是动态的、不断发展的生命。今天的我们并不是明天注定要成为的人， 。在很大程度上，我们的成长能力受到我们心态的影响。具有固定心态的人--那些认为自己的特质大多是静态的人--拒绝走出自己的舒适区来学习新技能，专注于看到别人的弱点而不是他们的优点，把反馈或批评看作是对他们的评判而不是学习的机会，并把失败看作是他们在某一领域没有任何天赋的标志。相反，具有成长型思维的人--那些相信自己的特质是可塑的人--喜欢学习新技能，从别人的长处中获得灵感，积极从反馈和批评中学习，并把失败作为学习、努力工作和提高自己的机会。因此，具有成长型心态的人最终会取得进步，而具有固定型心态的人则不会。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Neuroscience is providing a physiological understanding of how we can, with intention and discipline, grow over time. Each thought and behavior pattern you execute repeatedly, and have therefore grown comfortable with, has an associated neural wiring pattern in your brain. For behaviors that are new to you, your brain lacks the corresponding neural wiring. But if you intentionally and repeatedly practice these novel behaviors, then, over time, new pathways will form in your brain, because “neurons that fire together, wire together.” Once the pathways are formed, the new thought or behavior pattern will become second nature to you. Scientists call this neuroplasticity. You are truly a sculptor every time you practice a new thought or behavior—a sculptor of the pathways in your brain. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Second, the new science challenges the twentieth-century view that you are either one thing or the opposite. We can, for instance, be an ambivert—both an introvert and an extrovert. We can even exhibit opposing qualities in the same moment; science shows that people who simultaneously coactivate positive and negative emotions—experiencing both the good and the bad in a situation—tend to enjoy better resilience, life meaning, health, and motivation. Martin Luther King Jr. once reflected, “In my own life and in the life of a person who is seeking to be strong, you combine in your character antitheses strongly marked. You are both militant and moderate; you are both idealistic and realistic.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 第二，新科学挑战了二十世纪的观点，即你要么是一种东西，要么是相反的东西。例如，我们可以是一个矛盾体--既是内向型又是外向型。我们甚至可以在同一时刻表现出相反的品质；科学表明，同时激活积极和消极情绪的人--在一种情况下同时体验到好的和坏的--往往享有更好的复原力、生活意义、健康和动力。小马丁-路德-金曾经反思说："在我自己的生活中，以及在一个寻求强大的人的生活中，你在你的性格中结合了强烈的反面特征。你既是好战的，又是温和的；你既是理想主义的，又是现实的"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In fact, leading voices in psychology are recognizing that each of us is  already  a bundle of opposite qualities. Your personality is different based on whom you are with, and in what situation. You may be patient in one moment, impatient in another; kind with a certain individual, rude with another. If you want to master a quality that is new to you, look for bright spots—moments in your life when you have already felt, thought, and acted in the desired way, even if it was fleeting. Your bright spots will help you see how a given quality is already present within you; all you need to do is nurture and amplify it. And if you can’t see it in evidence in your own life, look for it in others. Research reveals that if you recognize and admire a quality in someone else, then the seed of that quality exists within you as well. As more than one writer has noted, “We don’t see people as they are. We see people as we are.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 事实上，心理学界的主要声音正在认识到，我们每个人都 已经 是一束相反的品质。你的个性根据你和谁在一起，以及在什么情况下是不同的。你可能在某一时刻很有耐心，在另一时刻很不耐烦；对某一个人很和善，对另一个人很粗鲁。如果你想掌握一种对你来说是新的品质，寻找你生活中的闪光点--当你已经以理想的方式感受、思考和行动的时候，即使那是短暂的。你的闪光点将帮助你看到一个特定的品质是如何在你体内存在的；你所需要做的就是培养和放大它。如果你在自己的生活中看不到它的证据，就在别人身上寻找它。研究表明，如果你认识到并钦佩别人的一种品质，那么这种品质的种子也存在于你的体内。正如不止一位作家所指出的，"我们不看人，因为他们是。我们看到的是我们自己的样子"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> And third, the new science shows that you will feel  more true  to yourself when you act in a way consistent with your values, even when those actions are contrary to your personality. For instance,  an introverted manager who has organized a party to celebrate her team’s successful launch of a product will feel more authentic acting extroverted at the party because it’s the quality she wants to express with her staff. Purpose triumphs over personality because Purpose is part of your Core, while personality is simply a brain wiring that can be resculpted. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 第三，新的科学表明，当你的行为与你的价值观相一致时，你会觉得自己 更真实 ，即使这些行为与你的个性相反。例如， ，一个内向的经理组织了一个聚会，庆祝她的团队成功推出了一个产品，她会觉得在聚会上表现得外向更真实，因为这是她想与她的员工表达的品质。目的性战胜了个性，因为目的性是你核心的一部分，而个性只是一种可以重新塑造的大脑线路。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This pattern became an annual ritual through my years at college. I was ranked the top mathematics student each year and would float for a while on the accolades I received. Then I would visit the ashram and receive a healthy bursting of my ego balloon from the monk-friend as he continued to gently nudge me toward inner mastery, not just outer excellence. Once, four years after college, I stumbled badly in life and shared the uncomfortable news with him. He received news of the failure with the same glow of unconditional love with which he had received reports of my prior accomplishments. On that day, I was especially grateful to him for accepting my life’s highs and lows with such equanimity. This monk has remained a treasured mentor to me for decades. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> We all need mentors to help us on our inner-sculpting journey—people who offer guidance and inspiration while having advanced in some meaningful measure toward their own Core, who only seek our highest good, have no hidden or personal agenda, are comfortable being candid with us, bring balance and objectivity to their perspectives, and honor our right to ultimately choose the pace and path for our journey. It is valuable to cultivate not just outer mentors but also inner mentors—people whose lives we study, whose stories we absorb, and whose guidance we seek within from time to time. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In studying married couples, psychologists have discovered a “Michelangelo phenomenon.” If you have an ideal self you wish to become, your chances of getting there are significantly boosted if your partner also sees this ideal self in you and supports you in moving toward it. In situations where your partner disaffirms you “by communicating indifference, pessimism or disapproval, by undermining [your] ideal pursuits, or by affirming qualities that are antithetical to [your] ideal self,” you are more likely to fail. This practice offers a powerful way to assess the health of an intimate relationship. Does each partner accept the other for who they are today, and yet see the best in their partner and support them in moving toward their Inner Core? </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The pursuit of Growth requires that we not simply  form  our social circle but  reform  it. Research shows that our emotions, values, and behavior are unconsciously influenced by those we spend time with. If you regularly spend time with people whose values are antithetical to your own, you may, without knowing it, slip into their way of thinking and being. One option you have is to respectfully walk away from such relationships. Another is to place boundaries around the kinds of interactions you have with such people—you will engage in certain conversations with them, but not others, and will do certain things together, but not others. And a third is to gracefully limit the time you spend with them. Making such shifts can be hard, particularly if you share deep mutual bonds with the other person. But if you are committed to your Growth, know that your progress may be seriously impeded if you actively and undiscriminatingly associate with people who affirm you for who you have been rather than whom you wish to become. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When you are by yourself, you are free from the expectations of others and no longer compelled to coordinate your experience with theirs. This allows you to think and act in ways true to yourself. By pulling you away from your social environment, solitude unshackles you from various forms of identity that the world imposes on you, like the roles you play in life. You are able to pursue deeper self-examination and make more independent choices about your direction. Gandhi aptly said, “In the attitude of silence the soul finds the path in a clearer light, and what is elusive and deceptive resolves itself into crystal clearness.” Einstein wrote about how solitude helped him cultivate certain inner mentors and allies: “Although I am a typical loner in my daily life, my awareness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has prevented me from feelings of isolation.” </p></div>

Everything is outward directed.… You have to learn how to deal with yourself.” How did Keith learn to cope with his situation? “I’ve watched quite a few people fall apart, lose their minds,” he recounts. “But I went in another direction. So 27 years later I’m still sound in mind and body and spirit.… My cell has a bookshelf with three shelves, and there’s a table to sit and write. I have a lot of music, books to read.  Not to distract myself from myself, but to take me deeper into myself. I paint, I work out, I do yoga, I meditate.” None of us would wish to be in Keith’s situation, and yet we can feel a great sense of appreciation for how he has used his time while incarcerated to become a near master at the art of solitude. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Some time back, I decided to institute a regular practice of fasting. All of us have a special relationship with the food we eat. Even on days when your boss is grouchy, or your spouse scolds you, you’re guaranteed to have those three or four moments when there will be something delicious on your palate to please you, just the way you want it. So at first it was hard to keep my fast. I felt hungry and deprived of pleasure. Then I started to notice that the real problem lay with my thoughts, not my behavior. During my fast, certain tempting thoughts would arise: “If you don’t eat, you’ll be joyless this whole afternoon.” “You’ve worked so hard. Skip your fast just this one time.” “C’mon, take a few tiny bites. Then go back to your fast.” “Everyone will be so happy if you ate with them.” “You’ve kept a fast the whole day. You’ve achieved 90 percent of your goal. You’re a winner. Now eat something.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 前段时间，我决定实行定期禁食的做法。我们所有人都与我们所吃的食物有一种特殊的关系。即使在你的老板脾气不好，或者你的配偶责骂你的日子里，你也能保证有那么三四个时刻，在你的味觉上会有一些美味的东西来取悦你，就像你想要的那样。因此，起初我很难保持禁食。我感到饥饿和被剥夺的快乐。然后我开始注意到，真正的问题在于我的思想，而不是我的行为。在我禁食期间，某些诱人的想法会出现："如果你不吃饭，你整个下午都会没有快乐。""你已经很努力了。跳过你的禁食，就这一次。""来吧，吃几小口。然后回到你的禁食。""如果你和他们一起吃，每个人都会很高兴。""你已经保持了一整天的禁食。你已经实现了90%的目标。你是个赢家。现在吃点东西吧。" </p></div>

I reminded myself how light and energized I felt when I fasted because my body wasn’t consuming energy to digest food, and how many other sources of happiness there were to my day. Every time I redirected my thoughts, I found it a breeze to keep my fast. I noticed that on the days I fasted, my mind was more focused during work and more easily interiorized during meditation. Instead of feeling hungry, deprived, indulgent, weak, imprisoned, rebellious, and self-pitiful when doing a fast, I started to feel joyous, light, energized, and free. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> And this is the lesson I want to offer you. When you try to change your behavior, some impulses within you will resist the change.  There’s a good reason you have been doing things a certain way thus far, and that part of you will not wish to die. You may find yourself relapsing into old behaviors. But if you chisel your stone at a much deeper level, uprooting limiting thoughts and beliefs, the behavior you seek will emerge more naturally. It is only when you start to feel joy in being the “new you,” when your thoughts, feelings, and actions are in harmony, that you will finally experience a lasting release from your old ways. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> This is how Steve Jobs described his Growth chisel: “For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to be doing what I’m doing?’ Whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.” Like our daily Core Review, Jobs’s approach was centered not on reasoning but on intuition. Though he may have gone against his inner guidance for days, when he finally found it impossible to ignore, in that moment he became ripe for change. This is what you will experience once you start doing the Core Review. You will begin feeling uncomfortable in fending off the whispers of your inner voice and repeating the same mistakes again and again. You will become increasingly vigilant not simply about what you do or say, but also about what you feel, think, and intend. You will become “spontaneously sensitive when important things happen” and begin taking steps to move in the direction of your Inner Core. By invoking its daily presence, you will feel a pull to doing your best and being your best, from within and without, in moments small and large, private and public. </p></div>

He and his six siblings had no precise knowledge of their birthdays; rural India of the 1930s had no concept of the Gregorian calendar. Perhaps this portrayal of his circumstances will help you understand why my father did not acquire some of the graces of modern-day love, such as the idea that every husband should present his wife with a beautiful gift on her birthday. He didn’t do so, and the absence of this gesture would be a lifelong disappointment for my more genteel mother. Then one year, when her birthday came around, he gave her a big hug, wished her happy birthday, and presented her with  an unexpected and lavish gift. My mother was in tears, moved by the unprompted metamorphosis in the man she had loved from the day she was his eighteen-year-old bride. It had taken him fifty-six years of marriage to finally acquiesce to expressing love in the language she had always wanted him to. He passed away a week later. It is never too late; a heart can keep growing till its final beat. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> T hough she was born in privilege—her family was part of New York’s high society—Eleanor’s life from the start was anything but smooth. She received little in the way of affection and love from her mother, Anne, who would scold her and say, “You have no looks, so see to it that you have manners.” Her aunt Edith wrote to a friend, “Her mouth and teeth seem to have no future.” The one person who gave her the love and tenderness she yearned for, her father, was an alcoholic who eventually had to be taken away to a sanitarium. Eleanor later recounted, “Mine was a very miserable childhood.… I wanted to be loved so badly, and most of all I wanted to be loved by  my father” and “I often felt that I’d like to have the floor open so that I could sink into it.” </p></div>

When she was ten, her father, who had been spending the night at another apartment, one day became delirious, knocked on the neighbors’ door to ask for Eleanor, and said, “Will you tell her [that] her father is so sorry not to see her?” An hour later he died. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As a teenager in a boarding school in England, Eleanor developed a close relationship with the seventy-year-old headmistress, Mademoiselle Souvestre. Souvestre, she recalled, was “far and away the most impressive and fascinating person” at her school. Like other girls of her time, Eleanor had been taught to suppress her natural curiosity. But Souvestre encouraged this quality. “You must cultivate curiosity, for only through curiosity can you learn, not only what there is in books, but what lies around you in the world of things and people.” Souvestre became a valued mentor for Eleanor, someone she could rely on “as a guide for me—to think of what I could do, rather than about what I could not.… Whatever I have become since had its seeds in those three years of contact with a liberal mind and strong personality.… All my life I have been grateful for her influence.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 埃莉诺在英国的一所寄宿学校读书时，与70岁的女校长苏韦斯特小姐建立了密切的关系。她回忆说，苏维斯特是她学校里 "最令人印象深刻和最迷人的人"。像她那个时代的其他女孩一样，埃莉诺被教导要压制她天生的好奇心。但苏韦斯特尔鼓励这种品质。"你必须培养好奇心，因为只有通过好奇心你才能学习，不仅是书本上的东西，还有你周围的事物和人的世界。苏韦斯特成为埃莉诺的重要导师，她可以依赖的人 "作为我的向导--考虑我可以做什么，而不是考虑我不能做什么....，无论我后来成为什么，都是在那三年与一个思想开明、个性强烈的人的接触中播下的种子....，我一生都在感激她的影响。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> One day Souvestre praised her in front of the school assembly, and Eleanor later reflected, “For the first time in all my life all my fears left me.” Souvestre described Eleanor in a letter to Eleanor’s grandmother: “She is full of sympathy for all those who live with her and shows an intelligent interest in everything she comes in contact with. As a pupil she is very satisfactory, but even that is of small account when you compare it with the perfect quality of her soul.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 有一天，苏韦斯特在学校大会上表扬了她，埃莉诺后来反映说："在我一生中第一次，我所有的恐惧都离开了我。"苏维斯特在给埃莉诺的祖母的信中描述了埃莉诺。"她对所有与她生活在一起的人都充满了同情，对她所接触的一切都表现出聪明的兴趣。作为一名学生，她非常令人满意，但如果与她灵魂的完美品质相比，这一点也是微不足道的"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> While in school, Eleanor began to change the negative beliefs about herself that her mother had ingrained in her. She later wrote, “It may seem strange, but no matter how plain a woman may be, if truth and loyalty are stamped upon her face, all will be attracted to her and she will do good to all who come near her and those who know her well will always love her.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在学校时，埃莉诺开始改变她母亲根植于她心中的对自己的消极信念。她后来写道："这可能看起来很奇怪，但无论一个女人多么平凡，如果真理和忠诚印在她的脸上，所有人都会被吸引，她会对所有接近她的人行善，那些熟悉她的人将永远爱她"。 </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Souvestre was a strong influence, but Eleanor’s insecurities would nonetheless persist for years to come. As she entered adulthood, “a certain kind of orthodox goodness was my ideal and ambition.” At twenty-one, Eleanor got married and focused on one thing: pleasing the people she wished to be loved by. “I left everything to my mother-in-law and my husband. I was growing very dependent on my mother-in-law, requiring her help on almost every subject, and never thought of asking for anything which I felt would not meet with her approval.” This was reinforced by the domineering nature of her mother-in-law, who wished to control all aspects of her household. Eleanor’s first son recounted being told by his grandmother, “Your mother only bore you, I am more your mother than your mother is.” During this period, Eleanor felt that she “had no sense of values whatsoever.” Her friend Joseph Lash wrote, “In return for the privilege of loving and being loved she stifled any impulse to assert herself.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 苏韦斯特是一个强有力的影响者，但埃莉诺的不安全感仍将在今后的岁月里持续存在。当她进入成年后，"某种正统的善良是我的理想和抱负"。21岁时，埃莉诺结婚了，并专注于一件事：取悦她希望被爱的人。"我把一切都留给了我的婆婆和我的丈夫。我越来越依赖我的婆婆，几乎在每一个问题上都需要她的帮助，而且从未想过要求任何我认为不会得到她认可的东西"。婆婆的专横跋扈使这种情况更加严重，她希望控制家庭的所有方面。埃莉诺的大儿子回忆说，他的祖母告诉他："你的母亲只是生了你，我比你的母亲更像你的母亲。"在这一时期，埃莉诺觉得自己 "没有任何价值感"。她的朋友约瑟夫-拉什写道："为了回报爱和被爱的特权，她扼杀了任何主张自己的冲动"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Eleanor’s first steps toward independence came in 1910, when her husband, Franklin, won a seat in the New York State Senate and the family moved away from her mother-in-law. “For the first time I was going to live on my own,” Eleanor recounted. “I think I knew that it was good for me.… I was beginning to realize that something within me craved to be an individual.” In 1917, when the United States entered World War I, Eleanor actively poured herself into wartime service. “I was learning to have a certain confidence in myself and in my ability to meet emergencies and deal with  them.” After a visit to St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, a psychiatric facility for shell-shocked soldiers, where she observed shoddy treatment and supplies, she pressured the secretary of the interior, Franklin Lane, to appoint a commission to reform the hospital. “I became,” she wrote, “more determined to try for certain ultimate objectives. I had gained a certain assurance as to my ability to run things, and the knowledge that there is joy in accomplishing good.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 埃莉诺走向独立的第一步是在1910年，当时她的丈夫富兰克林赢得了纽约州参议院的一个席位，全家搬离了她的婆婆。"这是我第一次独立生活，"埃莉诺回忆说。"我想我知道这对我有好处，....，我开始意识到我内心有一些东西渴望成为一个独立的人。"1917年，当美国加入第一次世界大战时，埃莉诺积极投身于战时服务。"我正在学习对自己有一定的信心，对自己应对紧急情况和处理 。"在参观了圣伊丽莎白医院（St. Elizabeth's Hospital）--一个治疗炮弹休克士兵的精神病院后，她发现那里的治疗和供应很不完善，她向内政部长富兰克林-莱恩施加压力，要求他任命一个委员会来改革该医院。"她写道："我变得更加坚定，要为某些最终目标而努力。我对自己的管理能力有了一定的把握，也知道了做好事是很快乐的"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> After the death of her third child in infancy, Eleanor was consumed by grief. But the terrible loss proved to be a catalyst for inner change. “Sometimes I think I cannot bear the heartache which one little life has left behind, but then I realize that we have much to be grateful for still, and that it was meant for us to understand and sympathize more deeply with all of life’s sorrows.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 她的第三个孩子在婴儿期死亡后，埃莉诺被悲伤所吞噬。但事实证明，这一可怕的损失是内心变化的催化剂。"有时我认为我无法忍受一个小生命留下的心痛，但后来我意识到，我们仍有许多值得感激的地方，它是为了让我们更深刻地理解和同情生命中的所有悲伤"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> By the time Eleanor was in her mid-thirties, Franklin was assistant secretary of the navy under Woodrow Wilson, and Eleanor was “running a household with five children and constant guests streaming in and out, [and] had nowhere to seek refuge.” She realized that if she couldn’t find calm on the outside, she had to cultivate it on the inside. “I learned that the ability to attain this inner calm, regardless of outside turmoil, is a kind of strength,” she wrote. “In this oasis of peace you are better able to cope.” Her growth during this phase of her life beautifully illustrates a principle she offered in her later writings: “Today, living and learning must go hand in hand.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在埃莉诺三十多岁的时候，富兰克林是伍德罗-威尔逊手下的海军助理部长，而埃莉诺 "管理着一个有五个孩子和不断涌入的客人的家庭，[而且]无处寻求庇护。"她意识到，如果她不能在外面找到平静，她必须在里面培养它。"她写道："我了解到，无论外界如何动荡，能够达到这种内在的平静，是一种力量。"在这个和平的绿洲中，你能更好地应对。"她在人生的这一阶段的成长，很好地说明了她在后来的著作中提出的一个原则。"今天，生活和学习必须齐头并进"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> But her learning didn’t all come instantly. When a state referendum gave New York women the right to vote in the 1918 election, Eleanor—who later would become a great champion of women’s rights—refused to cast a ballot. “I took it for granted that men were superior creatures and knew more about politics than women did,” she wrote. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 但她的学习并不是一蹴而就的。当州公投在1918年的选举中给予纽约妇女投票权时，埃莉诺--后来成为妇女权利的伟大倡导者--拒绝投票。她写道："我想当然地认为男人是高人一等的生物，比女人更了解政治，"她说。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When she was thirty-four, she discovered that her husband had been having an affair with Lucy Mercer, her social secretary. “The bottom dropped out of my own particular world and I faced myself, my surroundings, my world, honestly for the first time.” She suffered depression and struggled to eat. “There are times, I think, in everyone’s life,” she later wrote, “when the wish to be done with the  burdens and even the decisions of this life seems overwhelming.” After the initial shock of discovering the infidelity, Eleanor decided to stay in the marriage. She and Franklin committed themselves to supporting each other’s endeavors. Eleanor used the experience to become more emotionally self-sufficient and even more dedicated to the pursuit of her own values, pouring her energies into the social causes that mattered most to her. Her son James wrote that his mother had become “filled with a passion for politics through which she saw the chance to right wrongs, to be of use.” She reflected later, “Nothing ever happens to us except what happens in our minds.… Unhappiness is an inward, not an outward, thing.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在她34岁的时候，她发现她的丈夫与她的社交秘书露西-默瑟有染。"我自己的特殊世界跌入谷底，我第一次诚实地面对我自己、我的环境、我的世界"。她患上了抑郁症，并为吃饭而挣扎。她后来写道："我想，在每个人的生活中都会有这样的时候，""当希望完成 负担，甚至是这个生活的决定时，似乎是压倒性的。"在发现出轨的最初震惊之后，埃莉诺决定留在这段婚姻中。她和富兰克林承诺要支持对方的努力。埃莉诺利用这一经历在情感上变得更加自立，甚至更加致力于追求自己的价值，将她的精力倾注于对她来说最重要的社会事业。她的儿子詹姆斯写道，他的母亲变得 "充满了对政治的热情，通过这种热情，她看到了纠正错误、发挥作用的机会"。她后来反思说："除了在我们的头脑中发生的事情，没有任何事情发生在我们身上....，不快乐是一种内在的，而不是外在的东西。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> As she entered her early forties, she found that she was “drifting far afield from the old influences… thinking things out for myself.” Her values were becoming the pillars of her life. “To be mature you have to realize what you value most.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In 1933, when Eleanor was nearly fifty, Franklin was elected president of the United States. During her years at the White House she would transform the role of First Lady, becoming “the first (and only) First Lady to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, publish books and articles, travel the nation on speaking tours, chair national conferences in the White House, address national conventions of social reform organizations, give a keynote address at her party’s presidential convention, represent her nation abroad, travel battlefields, and direct a government agency.” She was famous for the notes, analyses, and recommendations she placed on her husband’s desk every night, lobbying fiercely for anti-lynching legislation, for a forty-eight-hour workweek, for a minimum wage, for funding childcare centers for working mothers, and for equal pay for women. All this at a time when women of her background, especially First Ladies, were expected to refrain from venturing into the public arena. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 1933年，当埃莉诺将近50岁时，富兰克林被选为美国总统。在白宫的这些年里，她将改变第一夫人的角色，成为 "第一位（也是唯一一位）定期举行新闻发布会的第一夫人，每天在报纸上写专栏，出版书籍和文章，在全国巡回演讲，在白宫主持全国性会议，在社会改革组织的全国大会上发表讲话，在她所在政党的总统大会上发表主题演讲，在国外代表她的国家，在战场上旅行，并指导一个政府机构。"她以每天晚上放在她丈夫办公桌上的笔记、分析和建议而闻名，为反私刑立法、每周48小时工作制、最低工资、为工作母亲的托儿所提供资金以及为妇女争取平等报酬而进行激烈的游说。所有这一切都发生在像她这样背景的妇女，特别是第一夫人，被期望避免进入公共舞台的时候。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In 1938, as First Lady, Eleanor attended a conference on human welfare in Alabama with fifteen hundred delegates. Black and white participants were required to sit in separate sections in compliance with Alabama’s segregation laws. When Eleanor first entered, she sat  on the black side of the aisle to express her disapproval of segregation, only to be told by the police that she needed to move because she was violating the law. So what did she do next? Eleanor pulled a chair from the white side of the room, placed it in the aisle between the two sections, and sat in it. “Courage is more exhilarating than fear,” Eleanor once advised, “and in the long run it is easier. We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, seeing it is not as dreadful as it appeared, discovering we have the strength to stare it down.” Lacking the ability to bring about instant change in others, Eleanor often looked to start a national conversation by taking a clear stand, to “interest people and bring about discussion.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 1938年，作为第一夫人，埃莉诺出席了在阿拉巴马州举行的有一千五百名代表参加的人类福利会议。按照阿拉巴马州的种族隔离法，黑人和白人与会者被要求坐在不同的区域。当埃莉诺第一次进入会场时，她坐在过道的黑人一侧 ，以表达她对种族隔离的不赞成，但警察告诉她，她需要离开，因为她违反了法律。那么她接下来做了什么？埃莉诺从房间的白色一侧拉来一把椅子，放在两个区之间的过道上，然后坐在上面。"勇气比恐惧更令人振奋，"埃莉诺曾经建议，"从长远来看，它更容易。我们不必在一夜之间成为英雄。只要一步一个脚印，迎接每一件出现的事情，看到它并不像看起来那么可怕，发现我们有力量盯住它。"由于缺乏给他人带来即时变化的能力，埃莉诺经常希望通过采取明确的立场来启动全国性的对话，以 "引起人们的兴趣并带来讨论"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Having grown so much in her understanding of herself, Eleanor took rapid strides in increasing her understanding of others. In 1918, she had lamented about having been required to attend a party to honor the financier Bernard Baruch, a Jew: “I’d rather be hung than seen at [the event].… The Jew party was appalling.” At that stage, she was expressing the antisemitism that was standard in her social circle. But over time she radically changed her views. Baruch himself became a treasured friend, “one of the wisest and most generous people I have ever known.” During World War II, she personally followed up on visas for Jewish refugees fleeing Germany, reunited families, and supported Jewish organizations, however small. When a Jewish woman, Elinor Morgenthau, was denied membership in the Colony Club, which Eleanor had cofounded, she resigned. Jeffrey S. Urbin, an expert on the Roosevelts, has noted that “she was at first a person of her times, who then explored issues and concerns and determined if she thought they were right or wrong, and then was not afraid to allow herself to change and become a better, more accepting, more balanced and informed person. And she then sought to enlighten those around her.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在对自己的理解方面有了很大的提高之后，埃莉诺在提高对他人的理解方面也取得了快速的进展。1918年，她曾对被要求参加一个向金融家伯纳德-巴鲁克（Bernard Baruch）致敬的聚会表示哀叹："我宁愿被吊死也不愿被人看到参加[活动]....，这个犹太人聚会太可怕了。"在那个阶段，她所表达的反犹太主义是她社交圈的标准。但随着时间的推移，她彻底改变了自己的观点。巴鲁克本人也成为了一个值得珍惜的朋友，"是我所认识的最聪明、最慷慨的人之一"。在第二次世界大战期间，她亲自跟进逃离德国的犹太难民的签证，使家庭团聚，并支持犹太组织，无论多么小。当一位犹太妇女埃莉诺-摩根索(Elinor Morgenthau)被拒绝加入埃莉诺共同创立的殖民地俱乐部时，她辞职了。研究罗斯福夫妇的专家杰弗里-S-厄宾（Jeffrey S. Urbin）指出，"她起初是一个属于她那个时代的人，然后探索各种问题和关切，并确定她认为这些问题是对还是错，然后不怕让自己改变，成为一个更好、更容易接受、更平衡和知情的人。然后，她寻求启迪她周围的人"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When Franklin died in office, it was time for Eleanor to leave the White House. President Truman called her back into public service by appointing her to the American delegation to the United Nations. There, she quickly gained the respect of fellow international delegates. She was appointed chair of the committee that drafted the seminal Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a touchstone of  liberty to this day. She brought to the task her own convictions, for all through her leadership journey she had championed the causes of the mistreated and the marginalized—women, blacks, Jews, children, the poor, Japanese Americans, war veterans, refugees, and more. But she also changed her ideas as the world around her changed. Article 1 of the declaration initially used the word “men.” Eleanor’s vice chair, Hansa Mehta, India’s delegate to the committee, said to her, “Excuse me, Mrs. Roosevelt, if you say ‘All men are born free and equal,’ around the world, it will be all men—women not included.” Eleanor recognized that Hansa was expressing the aspirations of a new generation of women seeking to question the old order, and agreed to substitute “All human beings are born free and equal.” A small step for the English language, but a big leap for womankind—and thus, humankind. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 富兰克林在任上去世后，埃莉诺是时候离开白宫了。杜鲁门总统任命她为美国驻联合国代表团成员，使她重新参与公共服务。在那里，她很快就赢得了其他国际代表的尊重。她被任命为起草《世界人权宣言》的委员会主席，该宣言至今仍是 自由的试金石。她把自己的信念带到了这项任务中，因为在她的领导历程中，她一直在为受虐待和被边缘化的人--妇女、黑人、犹太人、儿童、穷人、日裔美国人、退伍军人、难民等--的事业提供支持。但是，随着她周围世界的变化，她也改变了自己的想法。宣言的第一条最初使用了 "男人 "一词。埃莉诺的副主席、印度出席委员会的代表汉萨-梅塔对她说："对不起，罗斯福夫人，如果你说'所有男人生来自由平等'，在世界各地，将是所有男人--女人不包括在内"。埃莉诺认识到汉萨表达的是寻求质疑旧秩序的新一代妇女的愿望，并同意用 "所有人生而自由平等 "代替。对英语来说，这只是一小步，但对女性--从而对人类来说，却是一个巨大的飞跃。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> For her distinctive contributions at the United Nations, President Truman called Eleanor Roosevelt the “First Lady of the World.” From a timid, needy, rudderless individual, she had sculpted her way to becoming someone Martin Luther King Jr. called “perhaps the greatest woman [of] our time.” About her remarkable impact, she reflected, “The influence you exert is through your own life and what you become yourself.” And if you were to have asked her, “How do I go about shaping what I become?” she would have counseled, as she once wrote, “We all create the person we become by our choices as we go through life,” and on another occasion, “It is useless to resent anything in this world; one must learn to look on whatever happens as part of one’s education in life and make it serve a good purpose in the formation of character.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> O n August 20, 2013, as the eight hundred students of Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, an elementary school near Atlanta, Georgia, settled into their morning classes, a young man named Michael Hill walked into the school’s lobby with an AK-47 and five hundred rounds of ammunition. Another mass shooting in an American school was in the making. Thirty minutes later, Michael was in police custody. There were no casualties at the school that day, because Michael had been overpowered and disarmed. Not by a phalanx of security guards, but by Antoinette Tuff, the school’s bookkeeper, who had been substituting at the front desk. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 2013年8月20 日 ，佐治亚州亚特兰大附近的一所小学--罗纳德-E-麦克奈尔探索学习学院的八百名学生进入他们的早课，一个名叫迈克尔-希尔的年轻人带着一支AK-47和五百发子弹走进学校的大厅。另一起美国学校的大规模枪击事件正在发生。30分钟后，迈克尔被警方拘留。那天学校没有人员伤亡，因为迈克尔被制服并解除了武装。不是被一队保安制服，而是被学校的簿记员安托瓦内特-塔夫制服，她一直在前台工作。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Antoinette used no authority, commands, threats, weapons, or force on Michael. At every step of her ordeal, Antoinette offered Michael respect, kinship, kindness, and compassion. She asked for his permission before giving instructions to the 911 emergency operator who was on the phone with her. “You… want me to tell them to come on in now?” When he revealed his name, she forged a bond  with him by discovering a coincidental connection. “Guess what, my name is Hill too, my mom was a Hill.” Once Michael had been persuaded by her to drop his plan for a mass shooting, he started to turn his weapon on himself. Having saved the students’ lives and her own life, Antoinette now focused on saving Michael’s. “No, you don’t want that.… You’re going to be OK. I thought of the same thing. I thought of committing suicide last year when my husband left me, but look at me now, I am still working and everything is OK.” She reassured him when he was finally ready to allow the police to come in and arrest him. “It’s going to be OK, Sweetheart. I want you to know that I love you, OK… and I am proud of you. That’s a good thing you’ve done that you have given up. And don’t worry about it. We all go through something in life, you know. You don’t want that. You’re going to be OK.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 安托瓦内特没有对迈克尔使用权威、命令、威胁、武器或武力。在她所经历的每一个步骤中，安托瓦内特都给予迈克尔尊重、亲情、仁慈和同情。她在向与她通话的911紧急接线员发出指示之前，征求了他的同意。"你......要我告诉他们现在就来吗？"当他透露他的名字时，她通过发现一个巧合的联系与他建立了联系 。"你猜怎么着，我也叫希尔，我妈妈是希尔人。"一旦迈克尔在她的劝说下放弃了大规模枪击的计划，他就开始把武器转向自己。在拯救了学生和她自己的生命之后，安托瓦内特现在专注于拯救迈克尔的生命。"不，你不要这样....，你会没事的。我也想到了同样的事情。去年我丈夫离开我时，我想过自杀，但看看现在的我，我还在工作，一切都好。"当他终于准备让警察进来逮捕他时，她安慰他说。"会好起来的，亲爱的。我想让你知道，我爱你，好吗......而且我为你感到骄傲。你放弃了，这是件好事。而且不要担心。我们在生活中都会经历一些事情，你知道。你不希望这样。你会好起来的。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> We might suspect that Antoinette was a good actor, hiding her true feelings of fear and hatred. She did in fact later confess, “I was terrified.… That was one reason why I said to [the 911 operator] one time, ‘Can I run?’ I was just shaking so bad.” She hid her anxiety, but she did not have to hide her hatred, for there was none. “I saw this 20-year-old man standing in front of me,” she said in an interview. “He was the same age as my kids. I saw a young man crying out for help. At that moment he was not crying silently. He was crying out loud. I didn’t see the bullets on his back or the AK-47. All I could see was this youth in front of me.” On another occasion she reflected, “When he got to telling me that he wasn’t on his medicine and everything that was going on with him and all that, I really began to feel sorry for him,” and “He’s a hurting soul.” And finally, “I had tried to commit suicide myself, so I understood his pain. I pray for him every day.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 我们可能会怀疑安托瓦内特是个好演员，隐藏了她真实的恐惧和仇恨情绪。事实上，她后来确实承认，"我被吓坏了....，这也是我有一次对[911接线员]说'我能跑吗'的原因之一。我只是颤抖得很厉害。"她隐藏了她的焦虑，但她不必隐藏她的仇恨，因为没有仇恨。"我看到这个20岁的男人站在我面前，"她在一次采访中说。"他和我的孩子们同龄。我看到一个年轻人在哭着求救。在那一刻，他不是在默默地哭泣。他是在大声哭泣。我没有看到他背上的子弹或AK-47。我所看到的是我面前的这个年轻人。"在另一个场合，她反映说："当他告诉我他没有吃药，以及他身上发生的所有事情时，我真的开始为他感到难过。"以及 "他是一个受伤的灵魂。"最后，"我自己曾试图自杀，所以我理解他的痛苦。我每天都为他祈祷"。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> When we fall in love, or have a child, or develop a strong kinship with someone, our sense of self expands to include that other person. Their joy becomes our joy, their success our success. But perhaps those near to us were meant to be only the starting point; perhaps nature has, all along, wished for us to keep expanding our heart so that it can hold more and more of the world in its embrace.  In overpowering a would-be mass killer with love, Antoinette showed us those grander possibilities. </p></div>

These life-forms interact within their species and across species to keep the Earth in ecological balance. Each cell  and each life-form strives to attain its full potential, but also gives and receives from other cells and life-forms as part of a larger whole. Interconnection and interdependence occur at every scale of creation. We may think that planet Earth is the one special place in our solar system that supports life. What about other heavenly bodies? If Jupiter hadn’t existed, or the moon chose to quit in a huff, would it make any difference, practically, to our lives? It would. Astronomers have established that Jupiter is like a protective shield, absorbing asteroids that would have otherwise crashed into Earth and destroyed life. The moon helps to stabilize the Earth’s axis of rotation; without it, the Earth would become wobbly, leading to sudden extreme fluctuations in temperature—severe cold and heat—that would cause humanity to perish. </p></div>

As the coach passed over a marshy area, the men noticed a pig squealing in despair. Her piglets were stuck in the swamp, slowly sinking under. Lincoln asked the coach driver to stop, then stepped down to rescue the piglets, placing each of them on the dry bank in the care of their mother. Senator Baker remarked, as Lincoln ascended the coach, “Now, Abe, where does selfishness come in this little episode?” Lincoln replied, “Why, bless your soul, Ed, that was the very essence of selfishness. I would have had no peace of mind all day had I gone on and left that suffering old sow worrying over those pigs.

A student discovered that one of our dormmates, Derek Black, was a white nationalist—the godson of David Duke. Derek was very active in white nationalist circles and was seen as the future leadership of the movement. Students on campus started to treat Derek very poorly.

Some of the guests would debate with him the legitimacy of the science and facts that he had learned from the white nationalist community.

Helping others lights up our brain’s pleasure and reward centers, as though we were on the receiving end of the kindness, not the giving end. After helping others, people report feeling calmer and less depressed and experiencing higher self-worth. The practice of Love also makes us healthier—lowering cholesterol levels and blood pressure, alleviating stress and anxiety, and even lengthening life spans. And it improves our relationships, creating the conditions under which rewarding relationships can be born and sustained. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Love builds a bouquet of actions that lie at the core of great leadership. Organizational experts have identified leadership behaviors that are critical to making the workplace more human and to building strong cultures: coaching and developing people, listening mindfully, making compassionate choices, sacrificing personal goals in the interest of the group, acting kindly toward all individuals, building bridges with adversaries, letting go of grudges, giving others credit while cushioning them from blame, and causing people to feel a sense of belonging and inclusion. Love is at the root of all these deeds. If you did not take joy in other people’s joy or find success in their success, you would engage in these behaviors only grudgingly, with no heart in what you were doing, and people would see through you. On the other hand, if you have Love in your heart, these actions will flow naturally from you because they are what your heart guides you to do. </p></div>

The project had a marketing analytics focus, and armed with my PhD I was making strong contributions in designing our surveys and analyzing data. I started to tell myself, “I’m clearly more in command of our deliverables than  Jevin and the rest of the team. Jevin is a star at the firm, so I’m likely to become a star too!” Over the next few weeks, I discovered the source of Jevin’s success. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> At my weekly meeting with Jevin to review my work, I would show him a trove of tables and charts laden with learnings about the client’s market. He would take a step back to refocus on the client’s core issues, then creatively draw out strategic insights from my analyses that would provide real value to the client. “Jevin’s right,” I would have to admit to myself. “I was so deep in the data trenches that I lost sight of the problem we’re trying to solve and totally missed these insights.” Later, in previewing our findings with senior McKinsey partners before taking them to the client, Jevin would say, “Hitendra has identified three really important strategic findings. Hitendra, why don’t you present them?” I would be flattered but also flummoxed, because it was  he  who had come up with the findings. In those moments, he was letting me shine. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Jevin was always looking out for our team—keeping our workload in balance and nudging us to maintain a life outside the job. I saw him invest personal time with certain client executives to support their growth and success much beyond our official duties. In earlier times, I would try to get staffed on projects at McKinsey that focused on industries or business problems that interested me. But after this experience with him, I asked our staffing manager, “Could you staff me on whatever project Jevin is leading next?” After McKinsey, Jevin joined the executive team at Staples and then went on to become the CEO of a retail chain. Seven years ago, I received the following email from him: “I’m thrilled to share with you that I will be attending rabbinic school at Hebrew College this Fall. This has been a dream of mine for 25 years and something I’ve said is ‘when,’ not ‘if.’ ‘When’ is now.… My major professional focus will be Torah and the Jewish people. I’m grateful to [my wife and children] for supporting this move and my heart is filled with great joy about the days to come.” Jevin has shown me how the candle of Love can stay quietly lit in our hearts as we go about our work, and that much outer success will flow to us when we stay true to our Core. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 杰文总是为我们的团队着想--让我们的工作量保持平衡，鼓励我们保持工作之外的生活。我看到他对某些客户的高管投入个人时间，支持他们的成长和成功，远远超出了我们的正式职责。在早些时候，我会努力争取在麦肯锡的项目中配备人员，这些项目主要集中在我感兴趣的行业或商业问题上。但在与他的这次经历之后，我问我们的人事经理："你能不能在杰文接下来领导的任何项目中为我配备人员？"在麦肯锡之后，杰文加入了史泰博公司的执行团队，然后又成为一家零售连锁店的首席执行官。七年前，我收到了他的以下电子邮件。"我很高兴与你分享，我将在今年秋天去希伯来学院的拉比学校学习。这是我25年来的一个梦想，我说过的是'当'，而不是'如果'。'当'是现在....，我的主要专业焦点将是托拉和犹太民族。我很感谢[我的妻子和孩子们]支持这一举动，我的内心对未来的日子充满了巨大的喜悦。"杰文向我展示了在我们开展工作时，爱的蜡烛如何能在我们心中静静地点燃，当我们忠于自己的核心时，许多外部的成功会流向我们。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Love needn’t merely connect you to the people you interact with; it can also connect you to a cause, a company, a community. Steve Jobs’s practice of Love at work is best understood in this light. “When I hire somebody really senior,” he said, “competence is the ante. They have to be really smart. But the real issue for me is, ‘Are they going to fall in love with Apple?’ Because if they fall in love with Apple, everything else will take care of itself. They’ll want to do what’s best for Apple, not what’s best for them, what’s best for Steve, or anybody else.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In  Chapter 3 , “Ways of Knowing,” we discussed the journeys of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, starting with their divergent upbringing. King reflected, “It is quite easy for me to think of a God of love mainly because I grew up in a family where love was central and where lovely relationships were ever present. It is quite easy for me to think of the universe as basically friendly mainly because of my uplifting hereditary and environmental circumstances. It is quite easy for me to lean more toward optimism than pessimism about human nature mainly because of my childhood experiences.” Malcolm X’s childhood, in painful contrast, was bereft of an enduring, nurturing love. He held memories of fighting parents who beat the children, a father who died early, and a mother who had to be placed in a mental health facility. Perhaps this was why in college Martin embraced a more universal love for all people, while Malcolm for a long time could not do so. </p></div>

Children who lack this kind of love and support are more likely to grow up with an anxious or avoidant profile. An anxious person is less trusting in relationships, feels the need to be constantly reassured and supported, and struggles with handling conflict. An avoidant person stays away from experiencing warmth or intimacy out of fear that they will be disappointed or lose their independence. i </p></div>

We are more motivated, curious, and creative, knowing there is someone behind us we can rely on, and we experience less distress during life’s challenging moments. Scientists call this the dependency paradox: the more people we have in our life whom we feel loved and supported by, the less dependence we have on them. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Once, in my weekly team meeting, everyone walked in at nine a.m. looking particularly tired and drained. Instead of proceeding with the agenda, I started by asking everyone to stand in a circle, close their eyes, and take a few deep breaths. We were silent for about five minutes. I broke the silence by saying a team member’s name. I recalled my first interaction with this individual and expressed my gratitude for what I valued about the work he does and the person he is. I continued until I had gone through the whole team. By the end, we all had our eyes open and I even saw some tears from some people who are typically not that expressive. It was a moment of gratitude that we all shared and connected with. We felt a renewed sense of commitment to our work and to each other as the meeting and the day proceeded. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Gratitude is a choice we make about the heart-space from which we want to operate. One way to practice gratitude is by thinking of a person who has been very helpful to you at a certain point in your life, then writing a letter of gratitude to them, or simply feeling the gratitude in your heart. Another is by maintaining a journal in which you write down, every couple of days, two or three things you feel most grateful for from the preceding twenty-four to forty-eight hours. A third is by asking yourself, whenever you feel upset and want to lift yourself out of it, “What are some things that I feel really grateful for right now?” Science shows that these actions will increase your happiness. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 感恩是我们对自己想要操作的心灵空间的一种选择。练习感恩的一个方法是想到一个在你生命中的某个阶段对你有很大帮助的人，然后给他写一封感谢信，或者仅仅是在你的心中感受到感恩。另一种方法是坚持写日记，每隔几天写下两到三件你在过去二十四到四十八小时内感到最感激的事情。第三种方法是，每当你感到心烦意乱，想让自己摆脱困境时，就问自己："我现在对哪些事情感到非常感激？"科学表明，这些行动会增加你的幸福感。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> On a crisp fall morning in 2008, I stepped into an elevator on my way to the office of a well-known corporate leader. Let us call him Andrew. Andrew and I were meeting to explore a potential business partnership. As the elevator began its ascent, it struck me that my heart was not in the right place: I felt quite critical of Andrew’s character. I had had one past interaction with Andrew and had found him rather self-centered—very focused on his own agenda. A friend later told me Andrew had a reputation for being quite brusque. My thoughts were telling me, “Hitendra, life is short. You want to work  with people you like. Andrew isn’t one of them. You’re wasting your time here. So make this meeting brief, and then exit.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在2008年一个秋高气爽的早晨，我踏入电梯，前往一位知名企业领导人的办公室。让我们称他为安德鲁。安德鲁和我要见面，探讨一个潜在的商业合作伙伴。当电梯开始上升时，我突然发现我的心不在正确的地方。我对安德鲁的性格感到相当挑剔。我过去曾与安德鲁有过一次互动，发现他相当以自我为中心，非常专注于自己的议程。一个朋友后来告诉我，安德鲁有一个相当粗暴的名声。我的想法告诉我，"Hitendra，生命是短暂的。你想和你喜欢的人一起工作， 。安德鲁不是他们中的一员。你在这里是在浪费你的时间。所以，让这次会议简短一点，然后退出。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> But I realized I was passing judgment on Andrew on the basis of very few impressions. I remembered something a student of mine had told me Warren Buffett had shared with him: “I believe that 10 percent of every human being is very inspiring. When I meet someone, my focus is on finding the 10 percent of this individual that is truly inspiring.” I told myself, “Andrew must possess a beautiful Inner Core. Your goal today is to discover and connect with it.  You are going to walk out liking Andrew. ” By the time the elevator reached Andrew’s floor, my energy had shifted. Instead of being guarded, skeptical, and disengaged, I was friendly, open, and interested. Over the course of our exchange, I discovered that Andrew and I had a shared interest in certain social causes, and that he was taking major chunks of time away from his business pursuits to support those endeavors. I learned that, like me, he was very fond of animals, and had started a shelter for injured animals. Whereas earlier I had found him self-centered, I now recognized that he was focused in a laser-sharp way on causes he believed in. His purported brusqueness now came across to me as refreshing candor as he flagged certain political sensitivities in a C-suite team he and I were dealing with. By the time I left his office, we had established a warm connection. My relationship with Andrew has blossomed over the years. I smile sometimes and wonder what would have happened if on that day in the elevator I had not made the choice to reset my feelings so I could meet him with an open, appreciative heart. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 但我意识到，我是在很少的印象基础上对安德鲁作出判断的。我想起了我的一个学生告诉我沃伦-巴菲特与他分享的东西。"我相信，每个人中有10%的人是非常有灵感的。当我遇到一个人时，我的重点是找到这个人的10%是真正鼓舞人心的。"我告诉自己，"安德鲁一定拥有一个美丽的内在核心。你今天的目标是发现并与之联系。 你要走出去，喜欢上安德鲁。" 当电梯到达安德鲁所在的楼层时，我的能量已经转变了。我不再戒备、怀疑和不参与，而是友好、开放和感兴趣。在我们交流的过程中，我发现安德鲁和我对某些社会事业有共同的兴趣，而且他正从他的商业追求中抽出大块时间来支持这些努力。我了解到，和我一样，他也非常喜欢动物，并且为受伤的动物建立了一个收容所。早些时候，我发现他以自我为中心，而现在我认识到，他以一种激光的方式专注于他相信的事业。他所谓的粗暴现在在我看来是令人耳目一新的坦率，因为他指出了他和我正在处理的一个C-suite团队中的某些政治敏感性问题。当我离开他的办公室时，我们已经建立了一种温暖的联系。多年来，我与安德鲁的关系已经开花结果。我有时会笑着想，如果那天在电梯里，我没有选择重置我的感情，让我能够以一颗开放、欣赏的心去迎接他，会发生什么事呢？ </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Appreciation invites us to scan our environment moment by moment for ideas, experiences, and qualities that we find uplifting, and then make it a habit to stay in this uplifted state—about people, about life, and about the world.

And yet when we watch a film, we start to empathize with its characters; their joy becomes our joy, their sorrow our sorrow. Why? After all, these are actors— the characters they’re portraying are not even real people . Perhaps it is because in watching a film we take the time to listen to a person’s story, without judgment and with an open heart, and then we start to walk in their shoes. What might happen if we practiced this form of connection with whoever crosses our path in life? Could it make us empathize even with, say, the people we have a fierce dislike for? </p></div>

He greeted the twelve men who had been living in the residence with him and asked if they’d gotten enough sleep. He told them they’d become “more family to him” than any of his own countrymen, thanked them for having treated him so well, and shook their hands in gratitude. Then it was time. He was escorted into a waiting helicopter by these men, and, upon its landing, into an  armored bus. When the bus arrived at its destination, the man walked slowly to the front of the vehicle, stopping “to grasp each of the twelve young [men], and in a few cases, to whisper final private words. Some of [the twelve] now had tears in their eyes.… He turned to them one last time and said, ‘May God be with you.’ With that, he bowed slightly and turned toward the door.” </p></div>

When they learned of their assignment, some of them were so appalled by what a monster they saw Saddam to be that they wanted to kill him in his bed. Others wanted to transfer to different units. But as they spent time with Saddam, their feelings for him changed in remarkable ways. They developed a deep, empathetic bond with him. When he was hanged, several of the men experienced post-traumatic stress. One of them said, “I know I should hate Saddam, but it’s not easy.” Another said, “I felt like I let him down. I almost feel like a murderer, like I killed a guy I was close to.” A third reflected on how Saddam had told him, as his execution approached, “I forgive you, you’re just doing your job.” A fourth spoke about how, even though he knew that Saddam had killed many people, he still couldn’t help but see him “more like a grandpa.” The interpreter who worked with them said, “Will I miss Saddam the brutal dictator?

What took me most by surprise was not Hitler’s relationship with the people he  hated—that part has been painfully and painstakingly documented—but his relationship with the people he claimed to love: the Germanic Aryan “Master Race.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 几年前，我参观了柏林的 "恐怖地形 "博物馆。它建在纳粹统治时期盖世太保总部的场地上，通过一系列的图片和历史评论，它记录了第三帝国的兴衰。走过那个博物馆是一个非常有力的体验。 最让我吃惊的不是希特勒与他所憎恨的人的关系--这部分已经被痛苦地记录下来，而是他与他声称所爱的人的关系：日耳曼的雅利安 "主种族"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Hitler started by hating the Jews and the Slavs and the Romani, but over time he excluded and persecuted many people from segments of the “Master Race” itself—political rivals, people with disabilities, Germans who rejected Nazi ideology, and more. With every portion of the German population that Hitler turned against, his circle of love grew smaller, and his circle of hate grew larger. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 希特勒从憎恨犹太人、斯拉夫人和罗姆人开始，但随着时间的推移，他排斥和迫害了许多来自 "主种族 "本身的部分人--政治对手、残疾人、拒绝纳粹意识形态的德国人，等等。随着希特勒反对的德国人口的每一部分，他的爱的圈子越来越小，他的恨的圈子越来越大。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> And then came the final reckoning. On March 19, 1945, with the Allied armies advancing on Germany, Hitler issued a decree for the destruction of all German infrastructure—transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments, supply depots, and “anything else of value within Reich territory.” Historians have aptly called it the Nero Decree. If it had been implemented, postwar Germany would have been reduced to preindustrial-age conditions. Albert Speer, Hitler’s minister of armaments and war production, was so shocked by the order that he asked Hitler for exclusive power to implement it. Once granted that authority, Speer turned around and convinced the Nazi generals to ignore the command. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 然后是最后的清算。1945年3月19日，随着盟军向德国挺进，希特勒颁布了一项法令，要求摧毁德国的所有基础设施--交通和通信设施、工业设施、补给站以及 "帝国领土内其他任何有价值的东西"。历史学家将其恰当地称为 "尼禄令"。如果该法令得以实施，战后的德国将沦为工业化时代前的状态。希特勒的军备和战争生产部长阿尔伯特-施佩尔（Albert Speer）对这一命令感到非常震惊，他向希特勒要求执行这一命令的专属权力。一旦获得这一权力，施佩尔转过身来，说服纳粹的将军们无视这一命令。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Why did Hitler issue such a harsh decree? It had become clear to him that his game was up; he committed suicide forty-two days later. But on that day in March, he justified his order by telling Speer that the Germans did not deserve to survive: “Only those who are inferior will remain after this struggle, for the good have already been killed.” The Führer showed in that moment that his circle of love had shrunk to just himself, while his circle of hate—the people he was happy to inflict pain on—now included all the survivors of the German “Master Race” he had claimed to love. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 希特勒为什么要发布如此严厉的法令？他已经清楚自己的游戏结束了；四十二天后他自杀了。但在3月的那一天，他为自己的命令辩护，告诉斯佩尔，德国人不配生存："只有那些低劣的人在这场斗争后会留下来，因为优秀的人已经被杀死了。"元首在那一刻表明，他的爱的圈子已经缩小到只有他自己，而他的恨的圈子--他乐于施加痛苦的人--现在包括他声称爱的德国 "主种族 "的所有幸存者。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Hate puts us on a perilous path where we can slip from despising one person to a more generalized capacity to hate. When we loathe an individual or group, we train our brain’s neural circuits to judge some people as “bad.” Hatred can then slither unnoticed into our consciousness and take hold across a much wider swath of relationship territory—like cancer cells that metastasize. Research  shows that the feeling many people experience for their significant others isn’t just love but also, at times, hate. When couples who are in an unhappy relationship encounter conflict, they engage in criticism and contempt. In effect, they are in that moment becoming numb to their partners’ feelings, even wishing to hurt them. These are symptoms of hate. A person may come out of this state of hatred after some time, returning their partner to their circle of love, but a little damage has been done. Repeated flare-ups can eventually lead to there being, on balance, more animosity than love in the relationship. Sadly, in some cases, the only thing that eventually remains is the hate. </p></div>

Recently, there was a retirement party in his department for another professor. I noticed he didn’t go, so I asked him why. My father grew quiet, and then said, “Well, Anita, this colleague wasn’t exactly a good friend of mine.” I was quite shocked, because I rarely meet anyone who isn’t friends with my dad. I asked him what had happened between them. He hesitated, and then said, “Ever since I joined, this professor has been saying racist things about me.

<p class ="en"> When we love, our feelings get intertwined with those of others. This can be a good thing, for it makes us caring and empathetic. But research also shows that it can be a bad thing when it makes our love flow unchecked. Our judgments may get distorted: in seeking to please the person in front of us today, we may compromise the larger good of a community, or the longer-term good of the very person in front of us. We may get so emotional that we are rendered incapable of lifting up the other person’s spirits or calming them down. We may become so stirred by the grievances of the person we’re wanting to support that we do not seek to understand the other side’s perspective before taking action. We may end up giving so generously of ourselves that our own needs are sacrificed, leaving us worn out. Someone may take advantage of us by depending on us instead of taking greater personal ownership. We may avoid expressing our concerns because we don’t want to make people uncomfortable. Or we may refrain from making tough decisions—like terminating a project or letting an individual go—because we don’t have the heart to inflict pain on others. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Research shows that when people in a marital relationship report that they experience no conflicts with each other, one or both are conflict-phobic: so keen to keep pleasing the other that they simply refuse to recognize and raise sensitive issues. In the short run this leads to superficial harmony as the partner suppresses their voice. But in the long run it leads to simmering resentments or even a breakdown in the relationship. Research also shows that people who are kind and helpful to others at work can significantly compromise their career because they become consumed with helping others without being able to draw boundaries to protect their own interests, make hard calls, and create the space for tough conversations. It is no wonder that love gets a bad rap in many workplaces, where it is seen as a sign of weakness. “If I show warmth,” the love-skeptic thinks, “I will be seen as soft and pliable, and people will trample all over me.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 研究表明，当婚姻关系中的人报告说他们没有遇到彼此之间的冲突时，其中一方或双方都有冲突恐惧症：如此热衷于不断取悦对方，以至于他们根本拒绝承认和提出敏感问题。在短期内，这导致了表面上的和谐，因为伴侣压制了他们的声音。但从长远来看，这将导致积压的怨恨，甚至关系的破裂。研究还表明，在工作中对他人友善和有帮助的人可能会大大损害他们的职业生涯，因为他们变得沉迷于帮助他人，而不能划定界限以保护自己的利益，做出艰难的决定，并创造空间进行艰难的对话。难怪爱在许多工作场所得到了不好的评价，它被看作是一种软弱的表现。"怀疑爱情的人认为，"如果我表现出温暖，我就会被视为软弱无力，人们会把我踩在脚下。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Last summer, I interned at an investment bank. I dearly wanted to work for them, so this was a dream come true. But it soon became a huge disappointment. My supervisor, a senior partner at the firm, kept piling work on me. There were several summer socials at the bank for us interns, and I wanted to attend them so I could hang out with fellow interns from Columbia and other business schools and meet the bank’s associates and partners. My supervisor disapproved of my attending these events, so I never went. Other interns were having a much better experience with their supervisors! </p></div>

This is a big deal for all summer interns, and it influences whether the bank makes you a full-time offer. My supervisor came over to my desk and asked me to do a dry run with her. She listened to me with full engagement and gave me some great feedback, and then asked me to schedule one hour with her each day in the week ahead to do more practice. I was amazed that a busy person like her was giving me so much time and coaching. It was so valuable. My final presentation went well, in large part because of her coaching. After that, she called me into her office and said, “Congratulations. You’ve done very well. Earlier this summer, you weren’t ready. You had a lot of investment-banking basics to learn. People are quick to form impressions at this company. I didn’t want you to bungle your full-time prospects. So I was shielding you from the senior people at those social events. Now that you are ready, I am going to reach out to four senior partners who I think you should meet. I’ll ask for time from each of them for you. That should further boost your prospects of a full-time offer.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Sung-Ho’s story shows how Love becomes stronger once we prune it of certain extraneous branches of empathy. We can do this by using the discerning shears of the other four Core Energies. Purpose guides us to weigh what someone wants from us today against what may be best for them tomorrow, and to balance the needs of a person or group with the needs of other stakeholders or the community. It is Purpose that was guiding Sung-Ho’s supervisor’s expression of Love. Wisdom can be a helpful shear in making sure our emotions don’t get ahead of us. It guides us to actively practice  cognitive  empathy, in which we seek to understand how others are feeling, but to only selectively practice  emotional  empathy, in which other people’s feelings become our feelings. In this way, we can buffer ourselves from others’ emotions and keep our thinking undistorted. Growth guides us to go beyond empathizing with and validating people’s pain or anger to also inspiring them to draw on their inner reserves to act upon those feelings constructively, or to overcome them. And Self-Realization helps us build an impregnable castle of peace and joy within so that as we go about our day, empathizing and loving, we do so from a centered place. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> Sung-Ho的故事表明，一旦我们修剪掉某些不相干的同情心分支，爱是如何变得更强大的。我们可以通过使用其他四种核心能量的鉴别剪来做到这一点。宗旨指导我们权衡某人今天想从我们这里得到的东西和明天可能对他们最好的东西，并平衡一个人或团体的需要和其他利益相关者或社区的需要。正是 "目的 "在指导Sung-Ho的主管对 "爱 "的表达。智慧可以成为确保我们的情绪不至于超越我们的有用的剪子。它指导我们积极练习 认知 移情，即我们寻求理解他人的感受，但只选择性地练习 情感 移情，即他人的感受成为我们的感受。通过这种方式，我们可以把自己从别人的情绪中缓冲出来，并保持我们的思维不被扭曲。成长指导我们超越对人们的痛苦或愤怒的同情和确认，也启发他们利用自己的内在储备，对这些感受采取建设性的行动，或克服它们。自我实现帮助我们在内心建立一个坚不可摧的和平和喜悦的城堡，这样当我们每天进行同情和爱的时候，我们就会从一个中心的地方进行。 </p></div>

She said goodbye to me and my sisters, and then she and my father went away for a while to help her on her healing journey. We were told they were moving to Jerusalem. We never saw her again, because a few months later, she  died while in Jerusalem. For many years, I was deeply confused about her decision to leave us. Why did she not spend her last few months with us? What kind of advanced medical care was she getting in Jerusalem that she could not get in Rome? When my sisters and I grew up, my father once took us on a visit to Israel. In Jerusalem, we visited a monastery. The nuns we met there spoke lovingly of my mother. I realized this is where she had come in her last few months—these kind nuns had looked after her. I also then learned the two reasons why she had decided to leave us and leave Rome. She knew at that time that she was dying. She wanted to protect us children from the experiences that lay ahead. She did not want our feelings about Rome to be scarred by memories of her getting sick and dying in the city. And she wanted our last impressions of her to be of a happy, physically healthy mother; she did not want us to see her body ravaged by cancer. It must have been so heart-rending for her to say her last goodbye to her children and move on to Jerusalem, and yet this was also her final, thoughtful act of love for us. </p></div>

He made me feel much at home when I first arrived at TrueNorth. I soon discovered that Henry had been a legend in the photography world, having shot for leading magazines like  Time  and  Life  some of the most iconic twentieth-century photos of prominent women and men, including Eleanor Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Robert Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand, the Beatles, Luciano Pavarotti, and Nelson Mandela. I marveled at his photos and over the fact that he’d rubbed shoulders with all these luminaries, but I especially was in awe of his association with the Beatles, because I love the Beatles. He had captured them in relaxed, playful moments that hinted at a special intimacy he had forged with his four subjects. There’s even a photo of John Lennon combing young Henry’s hair. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In that moment, the source of Henry’s charisma came into sharp relief for me:  what Henry did with the Beatles fifty years ago is the exact same thing he is doing with me at TrueNorth today.  He takes a keen interest in his subject, in discovering their inner spark and celebrating their virtues. He puts aside his own agenda to be there for them. He finds a way to weave in his own ideas, but always in service of his subject. I have observed him do this with everyone he meets, even now, when he’s in his mid-eighties. Henry’s photography, his reminiscences of famous people, his friendships with Pavarotti and the Beatles, his performances as an actor on Broadway and as a principal tenor with the Metropolitan Opera, his interview on the TV show  60 Minutes —this is the stuff legends are made of. And yet it is not the peaks he has climbed but the Love he has put into his every action that has left the most indelible mark in people’s hearts. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在那一刻，亨利的魅力之源让我豁然开朗： 亨利50年前对披头士乐队所做的事，与他今天在TrueNorth对我所做的事完全一样。 他对他的对象抱有浓厚的兴趣，发现他们内在的火花并赞美他们的美德。他把自己的议程放在一边，为他们服务。他找到一种方法来编织自己的想法，但总是为他的对象服务。我观察到他对他遇到的每个人都是这样做的，即使是现在，当他80多岁的时候。亨利的摄影作品，他对名人的回忆，他与帕瓦罗蒂和披头士的友谊，他作为演员在百老汇和大都会歌剧院担任首席男高音的表演，他在电视节目 《60分钟》 中的采访 --这些 都是传奇的素材。然而，在人们心中留下最不可磨灭的印记的，不是他所攀登的高峰，而是他在每一个行动中所付出的爱。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In our daily dash, we often race through our motions with the sole aim of getting to the finish line. What possibilities could life hold if, like Henry, we made it our intention to put Love into every action? Love comes into full bloom when we stop playing hide-and-seek with our heart and bring it into active expression in each moment—through a pause to honor someone’s presence, a giving of our undivided attention, a warm smile, a caring remark, a genuine interest in how they are feeling, or a keen attunement to their needs. Perhaps the most  important person in our life isn’t our boss, our spouse, our child, or our best friend: it is the person in front of us at that moment. “Wherever you stand,” wrote Rumi, “be the soul of that place.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在我们的日常冲刺中，我们经常以到达终点为唯一目标，在我们的动作中赛跑。如果我们像亨利一样，把爱融入每一个行动中，生活会有什么可能性？当我们停止与我们的心玩捉迷藏，并在每个时刻积极表达爱时，爱就会盛开--通过停顿以尊重某人的存在，给予我们全身心的关注，一个温暖的微笑，一句关心的话语，对他们的感受的真正兴趣，或对他们的需求的敏锐关注。 也许我们生活中最重要的人不是我们的老板、我们的配偶、我们的孩子或我们最好的朋友：而是那一刻在我们面前的人。"无论你站在哪里，"鲁米写道，"成为那个地方的灵魂。" </p></div>

An absence of hatred or judgment. Complete forgiveness, once she’d disarmed him (“I pray for him”). Appreciation (“I’m proud of you. That’s a good thing you’ve done that you’ve given up”). Empathy (“I really began to feel sorry for him.… He’s a hurting soul.… I understood his pain”). Love merged with Purpose (she called the authorities to have him arrested). Creating a connection with him by sharing that she, too, was a Hill and that she, too, had thought of committing suicide. Simply telling him, “I want you to know that I love you.” </p></div>

First, she loved the “poorest of the poor.” Her purpose was to get to them and serve them, and she left it to others to address the world’s other problems. Ortega may have wanted to engage her on Nicaragua’s politics, but she stuck to her purpose. Second, she steadfastly refused to judge others, including fierce dictators. Instead, she found a way to  honor the goodness in all people and to uncover their Inner Core even when it lay hidden behind machine guns and masked men. Third, often when someone entered her presence and experienced her love, their heart would melt, and her purpose would become their purpose. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Mother Teresa grew up in Skopje, Yugoslavia (now Macedonia). Agnes, as she was then called, received an abundance of love from her mother, Drana, who often invited poor people to join their family meals. Agnes’s brother once asked their mother who these people were that they were sharing meals with. “Some of them are our relations,” Drana replied, “but all of them are our people.” Agnes accompanied Drana on her weekly visits to an old woman, File, who had been abandoned by her family, to take her food and clean her house. In later years, Mother Teresa recalled that File “was covered in sores, but what caused her far more suffering was the knowledge that she was all alone in the world. We did what we could for her.” At home in Skopje, whenever the children complained about a teacher, Drana would turn the electricity off and tell them, “I’m not going to pay for electricity for children who [speak badly of] people.” </p></div>

Agnes’s father had died when she was eight. “Home,” Mother Teresa would later say, “is where the mother is.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Agnes left home at eighteen to become a nun, never to see her mother and sister again. (Her brother had departed home to attend military school when she was fourteen; she met him again after thirty years.) A year into her monastic life, she moved to a convent in India  operated by the Sisters of Loreto, where she was deeply troubled by the poverty she saw in Calcutta. Twenty years after arriving in India she followed her inner call, leaving the convent to lay the foundation for a new missionary order to serve the “poorest of the poor.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The early months of her newly chosen life were difficult. She wrote in her diary, “Today I learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and health.” Her mind often returned to the comfort and security she had enjoyed at the Loreto convent, and a tempting voice within her said, “You have only to say the word and all that will be yours again.” But she persisted in her efforts to serve the poor, and eventually she was offered a permanent space for her work in the home of a family named Gomes. Even there, at times she had no food. She wrote notes to her host: “Mr. Gomes, I have nothing to eat. Please give me something to eat.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Gradually, the nuns came, the donations came, and world recognition came as well. Her organization, Missionaries of Charity, spread to 130 countries and grew to include over forty-five hundred nuns. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and in a 1999 Gallup poll she was recognized by Americans as the most admired person of the twentieth century. Wherever she went, people of all social strata, ages, and faiths received her as a global celebrity. And yet Mother Teresa had none of the trappings of a celebrity. Most people when meeting her for the first time were surprised by her diminutive form. She wore a white sari with a blue border and lived a very frugal life. She spoke plainly, in simple English. She performed the most humble tasks in taking care of the poor—washing them, feeding them, cleaning their toilets, sweeping the floor. The secret to her mystique was not outer charisma but an inner charisma founded on her unconditional Love for every human being and her commitment to put that Love into action. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Many good-hearted individuals and organizations have sought to serve the material needs of those less privileged, but Mother Teresa recognized that there was a much deeper hunger in the world. This  was File’s hunger, the hunger for love. In Mother Teresa’s service to the diseased, the destitute, the dying, and the down-and-out, she focused on feeding this spiritual hunger as much as she did people’s bodily hunger. When she spoke to a more materially privileged audience, she offered a call to service that spoke to that audience’s hearts. Delivering a commencement address to Harvard graduates in 1982, Mother Teresa said, “You will, I am sure, ask me: Where is that hunger in our country? Where is the nakedness in our country? Where is the homelessness in our country? Yes, there is hunger. Maybe not the hunger for a piece of bread, but there is a terrible hunger for love. We all experience that in our life. The pain, the loneliness.” She may have been the nun, and they the Ivy League graduates, but she was forging common ground with them and transcending their differences. Next, she mobilized them for a mission. “You must have the courage to recognize the poor you may have right in your own family. Find them, love them. Put your love for them in living action.” In this way, she conveyed a simple call to action after she’d prepared their hearts to receive.

One day some protestors gathered outside, concerned about the intentions of Christian nuns tending to the poor and the dying so close to the temple. The group’s leader walked into the facility and was struck by “the care with which the suffering, emaciated bodies of the poor were tended.” He went back out to tell his fellow protestors that he would be happy to evict the Sisters—on the condition that the protestors persuade their mothers and sisters to come and serve their community’s poor in the same way.

She only said, ‘Thank you,’ and died.” She continued, “I assure you, she gave me much more than I have given her. She offered me her grateful love. I looked at her face for a few moments, asking myself, In her situation, what would I have done? And I answered with honesty, Surely I would have done all I could to draw attention to myself.

I sent out a newsletter to each one of them, to each community, suggesting that each one write down what she thought was beautiful in her sisters and her community. I asked that each sister  send her answer to me. A thousand letters arrived. Just imagine! I had to sit down and read each one, making a list of each community and all the sisters. Later I returned the letters to the communities. The sisters were surprised that someone would notice such beautiful things in them—that there was someone who was able to see them. All of this fostered a beautiful spirit of love, understanding, and sharing. I feel that we too often focus on the negative aspects of life, on what is bad. If we were more willing to see the good and the beautiful things that surround us, we would be able to transform our families. From there, we would change our next-door neighbors and then others who live in our neighborhood or city. We would be able to bring peace and love to our world, which hungers so much for these things. </p></div>

Father Maasburg describes how on a visit to Spain Mother Teresa and her group were driven around by a travel guide, Pascual. When it was over, Pascual asked her to autograph a book for him. When he later opened the book, he was surprised to see that she had begun her dedication, mistakenly, he thought, with “Dear Father Pascual.” Ten years later, while sorting through his books, he stumbled onto this one and opened it to read her words again. Over these ten years, his purpose had evolved in a way he had never imagined-—he was now a priest. </p></div>

In contrast, Mother Teresa’s acts of Love were very simple and yet very moving. “The smaller the thing,” she said, “the greater must be our love.” One such small act she encouraged was smiling at others. “Every time you smile at someone,” she said, “it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.” What could be a simpler action than giving someone a smile? And yet doing it genuinely requires us to cultivate joy within, and warmth for the recipient. As Mother Teresa said, “Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier.

<p class ="en"> Truth-seekers of all eras have sought to develop ways to get to their Core using contemplative practices like meditation, chanting, prayer, and more. Hindu scriptures written by nameless authors from several thousand years ago discuss the intricate practice of meditation, and three-thousand-year-old seals have been excavated from the Indus Valley around India that show figures seated in meditative postures. Kabbalah practices of contemplation in Judaism go back to 1000 BC or earlier. Evidence of Taoist meditation practices exist in China from at least the fourth century BC. Two thousand years ago, Buddha made meditation a centerpiece of his path. The desert mothers and fathers in early Christianity actively pursued inner silence and continual prayer, and the writings of later Christian saints, notably Saint Teresa of Avila, are infused with descriptions of meditative prayer. Sufism evolved as a contemplative movement within Islam to which Rumi belonged. There is no single right approach to reaching one’s Inner Core; in seeking out the same mountaintop, you and I may choose different paths. </p></div>

A pioneering step in bringing meditation to the modern age was taken by Yogananda upon arriving at Boston Harbor in 1920. Yogananda brought the advanced meditation teaching of Kriya Yoga from India’s renunciants to truth-seekers worldwide. Today, many different meditation paths and teachers have gained strong followings. </p></div>

Research shows that with meditation, you learn to honor both states and to move from one region of your sphere of consciousness to another as needed. In celebrating with your team, you are being true to the part of yourself that is proud and happy about what they have accomplished, and later in the day you will turn your attention to the ailing loved one and be true to that concern.

<p class ="en"> Perhaps it is best to say “I am human” so you can identify with all that humanity is known to be capable of. Would that allow you to reach the peak of your potential? No. You would still be limited by the popular beliefs of your time about what human beings are capable of. For instance, could a human being live for three hundred years? Have an IQ of 300? These numbers seem outlandish to us today. But just in the past two centuries, life expectancy in the developed world has increased from less than thirty to seventy-five years. And every subsequent generation is demonstrating a higher average IQ than the previous generation. What might life expectancy and IQ scores be in five hundred years? My purpose is not to speculate on the arc of humanity’s progress but to point out that our present-day beliefs about what human beings are capable of are highly likely, based on past evidence, to be proven wrong on some future date. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The way to release yourself from your identity prison is to focus on what human beings have the  potential  to accomplish rather than  simply on what human beings  have  accomplished. Einstein said, “The difference between what the most and the least learned people know is inexpressibly trivial in relation to what is unknown.” Einstein wasn’t trying to be the “most learned person” of his time; he was reaching for the stars, to access insights about nature way beyond the grasp of contemporary science. This is what meditation can do for you. By stripping away, day upon day, identification with your outer, physical form, you free yourself from limiting conceptions of who you are to see much vaster possibilities. Meditation is a pathway to realizing your true nature—the borderless and boundless spirit that lies within. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In January 2017, British prime minister Theresa May appointed a minister for loneliness. “For far too many people, loneliness is the sad reality of modern life,” she announced. Science shows that loneliness is a disease that can hurt our physical and mental health. The typical societal response to address loneliness is to offer a lonely person avenues to build social ties. But science is showing that loneliness isn’t an outer affliction—it is an inner affliction. An individual can have many relationships and still experience strong feelings of loneliness. If you have felt lonely at times in the middle of a dinner with family or friends, then you know what I mean. Conversely, if you have gone on a quiet retreat, taken a long walk in nature, or spent a day by yourself absorbed in a book, without finding yourself yearning for others’ company, then you know what it’s like being in rich company even without the presence of another soul. </p></div>

You might say, “But I get all the love and companionship I need from my friends, my family, my colleagues, my spouse, and my admirers!” If that is your situation in life, I am happy for you. Now visualize yourself at the age of ninety. What if you have outlived your family and friends? Perhaps you’ll have loving grandchildren, or not. Perhaps you’ll still have companions, or not. The one thing you will certainly have, if you have cultivated it, is  the ever-bubbling joy and kinship of your Inner Core. The more you invest over the years in building this relationship, the more it will be there for you in times when no one else is available to give you company. I noticed this with my mother during COVID-imposed periods of isolation—her decades of meditation helped her maintain a rich inner life while she was cloistered in her home for endless months. “Divine joy outlasts everything,” Yogananda once said. “It is enduring. When all else melts away, that joy remains.” </p></div>

When you sit down to engage in a contemplative practice, your path to your Inner Core will be smooth or rough depending on how tempered your mind has been in your everyday hours. Contemplation isn’t a plug-and-play tool that you simply inject into your life for, say, twenty minutes, only to go back to living your life just the way you had been before. This is why in all great faiths, the guidance to pray, chant, and meditate has been placed within the larger frame of how to live consciously and conscientiously.

In effect, you are temporarily renouncing the world. I do not mean renunciation in the outer sense, where you give up your material possessions and join a monastic order. I mean renunciation in the inner sense, where you put aside your ambitions, worries, desires, attachments, urgencies, irritations, and other mental burdens. You may return to them afterward, but while you are engaged in your contemplation practice strive to free yourself of such encumbrances. </p></div>

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The interiorized mind invites you to take a spiritual bath—to wash away the debris of all burdens and attachments from your consciousness so that you can dive into the unchanging, pure, tranquil spirit within. Once you have trained yourself to perform this daily act of inner renunciation, you will find it a source of rejuvenation and reassurance in taking on your everyday battles. Different contemplation practices provide different techniques for interiorizing your mind. What’s common to most is the discipline of sitting still in a relaxed posture, with eyes closed, withdrawn from thoughts of the world. More advanced meditation techniques, such as Kriya Yoga, teach you  to take mental control over the subtle flow of prana, or life energy, in your body so you can withdraw it from your senses and concentrate it in certain centers, or chakras, in your spine and brain—essentially drawing the shades over your sensory windows to allow you to focus within while putting aside all distractions. Learning to interiorize the mind, using the right approach, is a crucial prerequisite to advancing your Self-Realization goals. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The human mind, like an untamed dog, often runs away excitedly in pursuit of a thought, a feeling, or a sensory distraction. Your goal should be to train this dog to do your bidding—to keep returning to your chosen subject of concentration. This requires you to practice a raw honesty with yourself about where your mind is, rather than giving yourself a pat on the back for simply going through the motions of a prayer or meditation. And it requires you to develop the tenacity to keep bringing the dog back to where it needs to focus each time it drifts away, until it learns. Some contemplative traditions, including my own, invite you in this stage to cultivate devotion, a yearning to go beyond the physical and mental experience of life so you can dissolve into your Inner Core. The right visualization, affirmation, or especially chanting, can help you open your heart to a devotional pursuit of Self-Realization. You are more likely to induce your Core to respond to your human call for connection if this call is serene, focused, and heartfelt. </p></div>

As long as the waves are present, moonlight reflecting on the lake’s surface gets scattered. But when the waves have stilled, the lake’s surface reveals the perfect image of the moon. Steve Jobs said, “If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things—that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more.” </p></div>

Your senses when you are in deep sleep are turned off; you do not register the conversations people have in your physical proximity, and you are not actively engaged in thought. Yogananda would sometimes describe the deep meditation state as “conscious sleep.” </p></div>

Silence gives us a new outlook on everything.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The more years we put into our meditation practice, and the deeper and longer we meditate each time, the more our brain gets rewired, and the more deeply rooted we get in peace, love, and joy from within. What used to be a state—the tranquil mind—becomes a trait. As Davidson and Goleman put it, “Our mental stages fluctuate between the healthy states—even-mindedness, composure, mindfulness, realistic confidence—and the unhealthy states—desires, self-centeredness, sluggishness, agitation.… The healthy states inhibit the unhealthy states and vice versa. The mark of progress is whether our reactions in daily life signal a shift toward healthy states. The goal is to establish healthy states as predominant, lasting traits.” They also write, “Science today is showing that advanced meditators show a brain pattern  while merely resting  that resembles that of a meditative state… while beginners do not” (italics are mine). </p></div>

That is when I took initiation in Kriya Yoga from Self-Realization Fellowship and began my regular practice of meditation. It has been my greatest friend since. After several years of practice, I once wrote to a friend about how I’d figured out why people take drugs, because meditation is after all the perfect drug—legal, safe at any dosage, free of charge, abundant in supply, devoid of side effects, available on demand, more effective (not less) with every use, 100 percent reliable in the joy it brings, and eventually getting us to a sustained high throughout the day. </p></div>

Let me ask you this: Would you ever conclude after a few piano lessons that you aren’t meant for playing the piano, that it is not worth your energy because you still can’t play Beethoven’s  Moonlight Sonata ? Of course you wouldn’t. We all recognize that it takes time and effort to learn a musical instrument, or a sport, or a new language, and that our early experience may not be that fluid or fun.

<p class ="en"> In my first year, I struggled while meditating to keep my spine straight. This posture is critical for the smooth flow of prana. In near desperation, I started placing a book on my head to make sure my spine didn’t bend. It wasn’t much fun to meditate while having to replace the book each time it fell, but mercifully, in a few weeks, the bending of my spine went away. A second struggle I faced was with directing my gaze to the space between my eyebrows, a crucial part of Kriya Yoga meditation. After two years of struggle, I decided over the holidays to make this gaze-fixing my  one goal  for the new year. Within a few months of this single-minded pursuit, I finally succeeded. Sometimes, I do an experiment by letting my back slouch, or letting my gaze drop. Then I straighten my spine, or return my gaze to the right spot. Within a few minutes, I can feel a deepening in the level of interiorization that then leads to tranquility or joy, brought about by these seemingly minor adjustments. I have learned how critical it is to not fall into the wrong habits, not even those that seem innocuous. Meditation is an exacting discipline, but it also rewards our loyalty generously. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> While there is an abundance of meditation teachers and teachings to choose from, many of those who claim to be teachers are not rightly qualified. Some are pilgrims at the early stage of their own Self-Realization journey. They have progressed enough to get swept up by meditation’s allure and to want to offer it to the world and make it their calling, but that does not mean they are ready to teach a path that can take you all the way to Self-Realization. And since there  are no credible “Top Twenty” lists of meditation teachers or institutions, it can be challenging to find a teacher who is both qualified and right for you. Here is some guidance on how to go about your search and on the pitfalls you will want to avoid. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 虽然有大量的冥想教师和教义可供选择，但许多自称是教师的人并没有正确的资格。有些人是处于自我实现旅程早期阶段的朝圣者。他们已经取得了足够的进展，被冥想的诱惑所吸引，想把它提供给世界，并把它作为自己的使命，但这并不意味着他们已经准备好教导一条可以带你一直走向自我实现的道路。由于 ，没有可信的 "二十大 "冥想教师或机构名单，所以要找到一个既合格又适合你的老师是很有挑战性的。下面是一些关于如何寻找的指导，以及你要避免的陷阱。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Investigate any path you are drawn to. Because meditation is an ancient discipline, many paths have been around for several decades—some for several centuries. What kind of energy does the teacher exude? Do you feel uplifted in their presence? What is their mission? How selfless is their motive? How long have they been teaching? What is it like to spend time in the company of this teacher’s community of followers? What are the main pillars of their teaching, and how do those resonate with you? What is the philosophy behind their path? Your teacher does not have to be living or physically accessible to you. Their energy can emerge through their life story, their writings, their audiovisual records, and their followers. The most powerful way to experience a teacher’s presence is within, as an intuitive feeling of their presence and their guidance. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 调查任何你被吸引的路径。因为冥想是一门古老的学科，许多道路已经存在了几十年，有些已经存在了几个世纪。老师散发着什么样的能量？在他们面前你是否感到振奋？他们的使命是什么？他们的动机有多无私？他们教书有多长时间了？与这位老师的追随者群体在一起是什么感觉？他们教学的主要支柱是什么，这些与你有什么共鸣？他们的道路背后的哲学是什么？你的老师不一定要在世，也不一定要在你身边。他们的能量可以通过他们的生活故事、他们的著作、他们的视听记录和他们的追随者出现。体验老师存在的最有力方式是内心，是对他们的存在和指导的直观感受。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> If you feel drawn to a path, run an experiment by mindfully putting its teachings into practice in your life for some time, spending time in its community, and determining whether it is helping you make progress. Once you have found a path you wish to make your own, commit to it. You may find it more appealing to mix and match, to sample, to build your own path based on what works for you at any given moment. But think of it this way: How many athletes have become Olympians by charting their own course, patching together different coaches’ ideas, without ever committing to a coach for a reasonable length of time? </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 如果你觉得被一条道路所吸引，那就做个实验，在你的生活中用心实践它的教义一段时间，在它的社区里呆上一段时间，确定它是否能帮助你取得进步。一旦你找到了一条你希望成为自己的道路，就致力于它。你可能会发现混合和匹配、抽样、根据任何特定时刻对你有用的东西来建立你自己的道路更为吸引人。但是，请这样想一想。有多少运动员通过制定自己的路线，把不同教练的想法拼凑在一起，而没有在合理的时间长度内对一个教练做出承诺，从而成为奥林匹克运动员？ </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Staying committed to your teacher helps tide you over during the dry periods—periods when you feel you are not progressing and start to lose motivation. In these times, doubts creep into your mind: “This path isn’t working for me.” If you give yourself the freedom to switch your teacher and path on a whim, you will feel like switching whenever you hit a dry phase. But then you’d never learn anything. Very few have made it to Self-Realization without a trusted teacher to whom they have been loyal. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 对你的老师保持承诺有助于在枯燥期--当你觉得自己没有进步并开始失去动力的时期--渡过难关。在这些时候，怀疑会悄悄进入你的头脑。"这条道路不适合我"。如果你给自己自由，可以随心所欲地更换老师和道路，那么每当你遇到枯燥的阶段，你就会觉得要更换。但那样你就永远学不到东西了。很少有人能在没有一个值得信赖的老师的情况下实现自我实现，他们一直对其忠诚。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Some of us may find it constrictive to follow a teacher. A true teacher would never ask you to blindly follow what they say; rather, they would guide you to discover your true nature and to heed your own inner voice. In yoga traditions, a true teacher is called a guru. The meaning of the word “guru” is “dispeller of darkness”; the guru liberates you by helping you discover your own light within. Your first responsibility, as a pilgrim on the path of Self-Realization, is to find the right path for yourself—one that will help you discover this light within. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> At Maharshi’s hermitage, he had hoped to engage in some form of intellectual inquiry on spiritual matters. Instead, Maharshi guided him to dive within. “The realization forces itself through my wonderment that all my questions are moves in an endless game, the play of thoughts which possess no limit to their extent; that somewhere within me there is a well of certitude which can provide me with all the waters of truth I require; and that it will be better to cease my questioning and attempt to realize the tremendous potencies of my own spiritual nature.

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> I n 1888, Mohandas Gandhi traveled to London for the first time at the age of eighteen and checked into a room at Victoria Hotel. “I was quite dazzled by the splendor of the hotel.… I thought I could pass a lifetime in that room.” Gandhi had arrived in the city with an important mission. His father had been the chief minister of Porbandar state, a prominent position, until his death in 1885. Gandhi grew up a timid and shy boy, and after being a mediocre student at school he had enrolled in college in India and explored the idea of becoming a doctor, only to return home five months later after failing his first set of classes. His older brother and he decided that he should pursue a law degree in England and return to India as an attorney. “The object of sending me to England,” he later recounted  to his brother, “was that we… might thereby maintain the status of our father more or less, be well off and enjoy the good things of life.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 1888 年 ，18岁的莫汉达斯-甘地第一次来到伦敦，入住了维多利亚酒店的一个房间。"我被酒店的辉煌所吸引，....，我想我可以在那个房间里度过一生"。甘地带着一项重要的任务来到了这座城市。他的父亲曾是波尔班达尔州的首席部长，职位显赫，直到1885年去世。甘地从小就是一个胆小害羞的男孩，在学校里是个平庸的学生，他曾在印度的大学里报名，并探讨了成为一名医生的想法，但在五个月后，他在第一组课程中不及格，就回到了家里。他的哥哥和他决定，他应该在英国攻读一个法律学位，然后回到印度当律师。"送我去英国的目的，"他后来向他的哥哥讲述了 ，"是为了我们......可以借此或多或少地保持我们父亲的地位，过上好日子，享受生活中的美好事物。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Here he was, at the very seat of power of the British Empire, of which his nation, India, was the crown jewel. “[I was] all the time smiling within myself.… At that time, my only thought was to acquire all the accomplishments which make a gentleman.” He took lessons in dancing, elocution, French, and the violin. He refashioned his wardrobe, wearing “a high silk hat top, a Gladstonian collar, stiff and starched… a morning coat, a double-breasted vest and dark striped trousers… boots… leather gloves… and a silver-mounted stick.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 他在这里，在大英帝国的权力中心，而他的国家--印度，是大英帝国的皇冠上的宝石。"[我]内心一直在微笑，....，当时，我唯一的想法是获得使人成为绅士的所有成就。"他学习了舞蹈、口才、法语和小提琴课程。他对自己的衣柜进行了改造，穿上了 "高高的丝绸帽顶，格拉德斯顿式的领子，硬邦邦的，上了星的......晨衣，双排扣背心和深色条纹长裤......靴子......皮手套......和一根银制的棍子"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Fast-forward to 1931, when Gandhi returned for what would be his final visit to London. He was there to attend the Round Table Conference organized by the British government to discuss the future of colonial India. By now, he was one of the most famous people in the world. His next stop after London would be mainland Europe, and Italian educator Maria Montessori had remarked in anticipation, “Everybody knows him, even the smallest child, in every corner of Europe. Everyone, when he sees his picture, exclaims in his own language: That is Gandhi!” In India, people had started to call him Mahatma Gandhi instead of Mohandas Gandhi. The word “Mahatma” means “great soul.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 转眼到了1931年，甘地回到了伦敦，这将是他最后一次访问。他在那里参加了由英国政府组织的圆桌会议，讨论印度殖民地的未来。现在，他已经是世界上最有名的人之一了。他在伦敦之后的下一站将是欧洲大陆，意大利教育家玛丽亚-蒙特梭利（Maria Montessori）在期待中说："每个人都知道他，即使是最小的孩子，在欧洲的每个角落。每个人，当他看到他的照片时，都会用自己的语言赞叹。这就是甘地！"在印度，人们已经开始叫他圣雄甘地，而不是莫汉达斯-甘地。"圣雄 "这个词的意思是 "伟大的灵魂"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> This time, there was no Victoria Hotel. Gandhi accepted an invitation to be a houseguest in the low-income eastern district so he could interact with the city’s poor. And this time, there was no “striped silk shirt” or “double-breasted vest.” Gandhi arrived in London in the same garb he had begun to wear in India as a symbol of his kinship with the poor: sandals and a loincloth that left much of his body bare. When King George V asked to meet Gandhi, several Buckingham Palace officials fretted about Gandhi’s dress. Gandhi responded after the meeting by noting that “the King was wearing enough for the both of us.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 这一次，没有维多利亚酒店。甘地接受了邀请，成为东部低收入区的房客，以便他能与该市的穷人交流。而这一次，没有 "条纹丝绸衬衫 "或 "双排扣背心"。甘地到达伦敦时，穿着他在印度开始穿的同样的服装，作为他与穷人的亲属关系的象征：凉鞋和腰布，使他的大部分身体裸露在外。当国王乔治五世要求会见甘地时，白金汉宫的几位官员对甘地的穿着感到不安。甘地在会后回应说，"国王穿的衣服足够我们两个人穿了"。 </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在这两次伦敦之行之间，被迷惑的甘地是如何成为被迷惑的甘地的？ </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> After earning his law degree, Gandhi went back to India. He later wrote, “[I was] so much attached… to London and its environments;  for who would not be? London with its teaching institutions, public galleries, museums, theatres, vast commerce, public parks and vegetarian restaurants, is a fit place for a student and a traveler.… It was not without deep regret that I left London.” Destiny awaited Gandhi on the other side—his initial meeting with Raychand, the diamond merchant, happened the day after his ship docked in Bombay. After a short stint in India, Gandhi left for South Africa to provide legal representation to an Indian client. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 获得法律学位后，甘地回到了印度。他后来写道："[我]非常喜欢......伦敦和它的环境； ，因为谁会不喜欢？伦敦有教学机构、公共画廊、博物馆、剧院、庞大的商业、公共公园和素食餐厅，是一个适合学生和旅行者的地方....，我离开伦敦时不无遗憾。"命运在另一边等待着甘地--他与钻石商人Raychand的初次会面发生在他的船停靠孟买的第二天。在印度短暂停留后，甘地前往南非，为一位印度客户提供法律代理。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> From South Africa, he wrote a letter to Raychand asking for his guidance on a set of hard questions: “What is the soul? Does it perform actions? Do past actions impede its progress or not? What is God? Is He the creator of the universe? If a claim is put forward that a particular religion is the best, may we not ask the claimant for proof? What will finally happen to this world? Will the world be morally better off in the future?” His fascination for late-Victorian London had started to fade as he became increasingly drawn to one goal, which he later described this way: “What I meant to achieve—what I have been striving and pining to achieve these thirty years—is self-realization.” On another occasion he declared, “If I found myself entirely absorbed in the service of the community, the reason behind it was my desire for self-realization.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在南非，他给雷昌德写了一封信，请求他在一系列困难问题上给予指导。"灵魂是什么？它是否执行行动？过去的行为是否会阻碍它的进步？上帝是什么？他是宇宙的创造者吗？如果有人宣称某个宗教是最好的，我们可以不要求宣称者提供证据吗？这个世界最终会发生什么？这个世界将来在道德上会更好吗？"他对晚维多利亚时代的伦敦的迷恋已经开始消退，因为他越来越被一个目标所吸引，他后来这样描述。"我所要实现的--这三十年来我一直在努力和渴望实现的--是自我实现"。在另一个场合，他宣称："如果我发现自己完全沉浸在为社会服务中，其背后的原因是我对自我实现的渴望"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In the years that followed, Gandhi pursued Self-Realization not only by plumbing the depths of his consciousness to enter his Inner Core but also by guiding admirers and adversaries alike to discover their own Core. He saw the two actions as related. “[It is] my experiments in the spiritual field, which are known only to me… from which I have derived such power as I possess for working in the political field.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在随后的岁月里，甘地不仅通过挖掘他的意识深处以进入他的内在核心来追求自我实现，而且还通过引导崇拜者和对手来发现他们自己的核心。他认为这两项行动是相关的。"[这是]我在精神领域的实验，只有我自己知道......我从这些实验中获得了我在政治领域工作所拥有的这种力量。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> One of the first steps Gandhi took on his journey to Self-Realization was to implement a practice of silence. “I visited a Trappist monastery in South Africa.… Most of the inmates of that place were under a vow of silence. I inquired of the Father the motive of it and he said the motive is apparent: ‘We are frail human beings. We do not know very often what we say. If we want to listen to the still small voice that is always speaking within us, it will not be  heard if we continually speak.’ I understood that precious lesson. I know the secret of silence.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 甘地在自我实现的道路上采取的第一个步骤是实行沉默的做法。"我访问了南非的一个特拉皮斯特修道院....，那里的大多数囚犯都发过誓要保持沉默。我向神父询问它的动机，他说动机很明显：'我们是脆弱的人类。我们往往不知道自己说了什么。如果我们想听那始终在我们内心深处说话的寂静的小声音，如果我们不断地说话，它就不会被 。我明白了这个宝贵的教训。我知道了沉默的秘密"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> As a youth, Gandhi had been uninterested in prayer. “I started with disbelief in God and prayer,” he said, but then at a “late stage in life [I felt a] void.” At thirty-six, he made prayer a regular practice. “Prayer has been the saving of my life,” said he. “I have had my fair share of the bitterest public and private experiences. They threw me into temporary despair, but if I was able to get rid of it, it was because of prayer.… In spite of despair staring me in the face on the political horizon, I have never lost my peace.… That peace, I tell you, comes from prayer.” On one occasion he announced, “I have so much to accomplish today that I must meditate for two hours instead of one.” He also once reflected on how prayer can reshape our relationship with the world: “Prayer is the greatest binding force, making for the solidarity and oneness of the human family. If a person realizes his unity with God through prayer, he will look upon everybody as himself. The outer must reflect the inner.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 年轻时，甘地曾对祈祷不感兴趣。他说："我开始时不相信上帝和祈祷，"但后来在 "生命的晚期[我感到]空虚"。三十六岁时，他将祈祷作为一种常规做法。"他说："祈祷一直是我生命的救赎。他说："我有过最惨痛的公共和私人经历。它们使我陷入暂时的绝望，但如果我能够摆脱它，那是因为祈祷....，尽管政治地平线上的绝望盯着我的脸，但我从未失去我的和平....，我告诉你们，这种和平来自祈祷。"有一次，他宣布："我今天有很多事情要完成，我必须打坐两个小时，而不是一个小时。"他还曾反思过祈祷如何重塑我们与世界的关系："祈祷是最大的约束力，使人类大家庭团结一致，合而为一。如果一个人通过祈祷意识到他与上帝的统一性，他就会把每个人都看成自己。外在必须反映内在"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In his early days, Gandhi embraced the racist sentiments prevalent in those times. In South Africa, this attitude initially made him distance himself from the black community, in part to demonstrate that Indians were closer in racial status to whites. As he grew in Self-Realization, he started to see the world very differently. In a speech in Johannesburg in 1908, he stated, “If we look into the future, is it not a heritage we have to leave to posterity that all the different races commingle and produce a civilization that perhaps the world has not yet seen?” It was this much-transformed Gandhi that left South Africa twenty-one years later. As Nelson Mandela later put it on a visit to India, “You gave us Mohandas; we returned him to you as Mahatma.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在他的早期，甘地接受了那个时代盛行的种族主义情绪。在南非，这种态度最初使他与黑人社区保持距离，部分原因是为了证明印度人在种族地位上更接近白人。随着他在自我实现方面的成长，他开始以非常不同的方式看待这个世界。1908年在约翰内斯堡的一次演讲中，他说："如果我们展望未来，所有不同的种族融合在一起，产生一种也许世界上还没有见过的文明，这难道不是我们要留给后人的遗产吗？"二十一年后离开南非的正是这个已经大变样的甘地。正如纳尔逊-曼德拉后来在访问印度时所说："你们给了我们莫汉达斯；我们把他作为圣雄还给了你们"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Soon after his return to India, Gandhi began to actively pursue social and political reform there. The strain the work placed on him made him at times feel he was “being torn to pieces.” To rebuild his inner state, he decided to reserve Monday as a day of silence for himself. From then on, he never spoke on Mondays except during emergencies. At the Round Table Conference he attended in London, the first day happened to be a Monday; he participated  without speaking a word. On Tuesday morning, he gave the address that led his personal secretary to observe to a British journalist that what Gandhi spoke, felt, thought, and did was always the same. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 回到印度后不久，甘地开始在那里积极进行社会和政治改革。这项工作给他带来的压力使他有时感到自己 "被撕成了碎片"。为了重建他的内心状态，他决定将周一作为自己的沉默日。从此以后，除了紧急情况，他在周一从不说话。在他参加的伦敦圆桌会议上，第一天恰好是星期一；他一言不发地参加了 。周二上午，他发表了讲话，他的私人秘书对一位英国记者说，甘地所说、所感、所想、所做的总是一样的。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Gandhi strove to cultivate the tempered mind. The American journalist Louis Fischer, who spent time with Gandhi while penning a biography of him, wrote, “He had a violent nature and his subsequent mahatma-calm was the product of long training in temperament-control. He did not easily become an even-minded, desireless yogi. He had to remold himself. Recognizing his deficiencies, he made a conscious effort to grow and change and restrain his bad impulses. He turned himself into a different person. He was a remarkable case of second birth in one lifetime.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 甘地努力培养有节制的思想。美国记者路易斯-菲舍尔（Louis Fischer）在撰写甘地的传记时与甘地相处了一段时间，他写道："他有一个暴力的天性，他后来的圣母平静是长期训练性情控制的产物。他并不容易成为一个心态平和、无欲无求的瑜伽士。他必须重新塑造自己。认识到自己的不足，他有意识地努力成长和改变，克制自己的不良冲动。他把自己变成了一个不同的人。他是一世中第二次出生的杰出案例。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Beyond temperance, Gandhi was seeking the tranquil mind, the stillness that goes beyond thought and feelings, a state he called “silent prayer.” He wrote, </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 除了节制之外，甘地还在寻求心灵的宁静，超越思想和感情的静止，他称之为 "无声的祈祷 "的状态。他写道 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> True meditation consists in closing the eyes and ears of the mind to all else, except the object of one’s devotion.… Emptying the mind of all conscious processes of thought and filling it with the spirit of God unmanifest brings one ineffable peace and attunes the soul with the Infinite.… [We should] make a serious effort to throw off the attachments of the world for a while… to make a serious endeavor to remain, so to say, out of the flesh.… The practice of complete withdrawal of the mind from all outward things, even though it might be only for a few minutes every day, will be found to be of infinite use. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 真正的冥想包括关闭眼睛和耳朵，除了一个人的奉献对象外，对其他一切....，清空所有有意识的思想过程，用未显现的上帝的精神来填充它，给人带来不可言喻的和平，使灵魂与无限相适应。...[我们应该]认真努力，暂时抛开世界的牵挂...认真努力，保持，可以说，脱离肉体....，把心思完全从一切外在事物中抽离出来的做法，即使每天只有几分钟，也会发现有无限的作用。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In his later years, Gandhi was in a train going uphill when the coach became disconnected from the engine and started to roll downhill, gaining speed as it went. Passengers around him were terrified; the coach could at any moment derail and fall off the hill. But Gandhi continued dictating a note to an assistant, who exclaimed, “[Sir], do you know what is happening? We may not be alive. We are in-between life and death. The coach is moving backward with nothing to stop it, and it’s gaining speed.” Gandhi, unimpressed, replied,  “If we die, we die. But if we are saved, we would have wasted all this time.” He guided his assistant to keep writing until the future resolved itself—and they did not die that day. In that moment, Gandhi was displaying the centered state that defines the peak of Self-Realization: the unshakable mind. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在他的晚年，甘地在一列上坡的火车上，车厢与发动机脱节，开始向下坡滚动，速度越来越快。他周围的乘客都吓坏了；车厢随时都可能脱轨，掉下山去。但甘地继续向一位助手口述纸条，后者惊呼："[先生]，你知道正在发生什么吗？我们可能不会活着。我们在生与死之间。马车正在向后移动，没有任何东西可以阻止它，而且速度越来越快。"甘地不以为然，回答说： "如果我们死了，我们就死了。但如果我们得救了，我们就浪费了这一切时间"。他指导他的助手继续写作，直到未来解决自己的问题--那天他们并没有死。在那一刻，甘地展示了定义自我实现的高峰的中心状态：不可动摇的心。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Gandhi once led a peace march in a riot-torn area of Bengal. While he was walking through a prominent Muslim section of the region, a fanatic rushed up to him, grabbed his throat, and threw him to the ground. Gandhi immediately started to recite verses he had memorized from the Quran, verses that invoked God’s mercy and guidance. The man, Allahdad Khan Mondol, was startled to hear such a fine recital from his scripture. He apologized and eventually became one of Gandhi’s followers. Gandhi’s deep study of world scriptures had convinced him that they represent different paths to Self-Realization; in that life-threatening moment, his unshakable mind found the right path to awaken Mondol to the peace and love ever present in his Core. </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 甘地曾在孟加拉的一个骚乱地区领导过一次和平游行。当他走过该地区一个著名的穆斯林区时，一个狂热分子冲到他面前，掐住他的喉咙，把他扔到地上。甘地立即开始背诵他所背诵的《古兰经》中的经文，这些经文援引了真主的怜悯和指导。那个叫阿拉达德-汗-蒙多尔的人听到他的经文中如此精彩的背诵，感到很惊愕。他表示歉意，并最终成为甘地的追随者之一。甘地对世界经文的深入研究使他相信，这些经文代表了通往自我实现的不同道路；在那个威胁生命的时刻，他那不可动摇的思想找到了正确的道路，唤醒了蒙多尔，使他的核心永远存在着和平与爱。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> In 1922, Gandhi was arrested by the British government and tried for fomenting unrest in India. At his trial, he did not defend himself. He accepted the prosecutor’s charges, and then made an impassioned case for how British colonial rule was morally degrading for the British and destructive for India, and why it was the duty of every Indian patriot to challenge unjust British policies and laws and seek India’s independence. He ended by telling the judge, “The only course open to you, the judge, is either to resign your post and thus disassociate yourself from evil, if you feel that the law you are called upon to administer is an evil and that in reality I am innocent; or to inflict on me the severest penalty, if you believe that the system and the law you are assisting to administer are good for the people of this country, and that my activity is therefore injurious to the public weal.” Here, he was exercising a key principle of satyagraha—the idea that every individual has a conscience, and our only aspiration should be to help people awaken and follow their own inner voice. The judge was visibly moved, saying, “The law is no respecter of persons. Nevertheless, it will be impossible to ignore the fact that you are in a different category from any person I have ever tried or am likely to try.” After sentencing Gandhi to six years in prison based on the law, he added, “And I should like to say in doing so that if the course of events in India makes it possible for the government to reduce the period and release you no one will be better pleased than I.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 1922年，甘地被英国政府逮捕，并因在印度煽动动乱而被审判。在审判中，他没有为自己辩护。他接受了检察官的指控，然后慷慨陈词，说明英国的殖民统治在道德上对英国人是一种侮辱，对印度是一种破坏，以及为什么每个印度爱国者都有责任挑战不公正的英国政策和法律，寻求印度的独立。他最后对法官说："法官，你唯一的选择是，如果你觉得你要执行的法律是邪恶的，而实际上我是无辜的，那么你就辞去你的职务，从而与邪恶划清界限；如果你认为你协助执行的制度和法律对这个国家的人民是有益的，而我的活动因此损害了公共利益，那么就对我施以最严厉的惩罚。"在这里，他行使了萨蒂格拉哈的一个关键原则--每个人都有自己的良心，我们唯一的愿望应该是帮助人们唤醒并遵循他们自己内心的声音。法官明显被感动了，他说："法律是不尊重人的。然而，不可能忽视这样一个事实，即你与我曾经审判或可能审判的任何一个人都是不同的"。在根据法律判处甘地六年监禁后，他又说："我想说的是，如果印度的事态发展使政府有可能缩短期限并释放你，没有人会比我更高兴。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> On his visit to London for the Round Table Conference, Gandhi asked to travel to Lancashire to visit its laid-off textile mill workers. As a colony, India had been forced by Britain to export cotton at low prices to British mills, where it was manufactured into cloth and sold back to Indians at a big premium—enriching Britain’s coffers, but impoverishing India. So Gandhi had championed a movement in India to boycott British textiles, ultimately leading to the closure of Lancashire mills. The British government was concerned about  Gandhi visiting Lancashire on the assumption that the mill workers would be angry with him. But Gandhi, who saw the workers for their Core, was confident that he could, through dialog, win them over. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Gandhi once described soul force as “gentle, it never wounds. It must not be the result of anger or malice. It is never fussy, never impatient, never vociferous. It is the direct opposite of compulsion. It was conceived as a complete substitute for violence.” His goal was to show people that soul force—the capacity for heroic sacrifice to peacefully advance just causes in the world—was their native state, and that in small and silent ways, it already operated in their relationships at home and beyond. When a skeptic pointed to how there was no historical evidence of the existence or use of soul force in social transformation, Gandhi responded, “History, as we know it, is a record of the wars of the world… how kings played, how they became enemies of one another, how they murdered one another.… History is really a record of every interruption of the even working of the force of love or of the soul.” He went on to highlight how soul force silently operates in everyday people’s lives: </p></div>

So he set up ashram communities in South Africa and later in India, where he welcomed people from around the world to live with him. The ashram routine included prayers, right diet, exercise, and other practices designed to help residents cultivate their Inner Core. Gandhi took a keen interest in the residents, tracking their individual progress, offering personal counsel, and maintaining a joyful environment. He wrote, “Just as physical training [needs] to be imparted through physical exercise, and intellectual through intellectual exercise, even so the training of the spirit [is] possible only through the exercise of the spirit.

<p class ="en"> In 1930, Gandhi wanted to build a nationwide civil disobedience movement against British rule. To the surprise of all, he decided to focus it on something as trite as salt. Britain’s salt law prohibited Indians from producing their own salt so they would be required to buy the more expensive British salt. Jawaharlal Nehru, who later  became India’s first prime minister, recalled that when Gandhi proposed a protest against the salt law, “We were bewildered and could not fit in a national struggle with common salt.” A leading newspaper,  The Stateman , wrote, “It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians.” But Gandhi was unperturbed. His inner voice had led him to the idea of organizing a Salt March, during which he would walk with a group of followers all the way to the ocean and defy the law by simply drawing salt out of the water. “I had not the ghost of a suspicion how the breach of the salt law would work itself out,” he declared. “But like a flash it came, and as you know, it was enough to shake the country from one end to the other.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 1930年，甘地想建立一个全国性的反对英国统治的公民不服从运动。令所有人吃惊的是，他决定将运动的重点放在像盐这样老套的东西上。英国的盐法禁止印度人自己生产盐，因此他们必须购买更昂贵的英国盐。后来 ，成为印度第一任总理的贾瓦哈拉尔-尼赫鲁回忆说，当甘地提出抗议盐法时，"我们感到很困惑，无法用普通的盐来配合民族斗争"。一家主要报纸 《国家人》 写道："很难不笑，我们想象这将是大多数有思想的印度人的心情"。但甘地并不感到不安。他内心的声音使他产生了组织盐业游行的想法，在游行期间，他将与一群追随者一路走到海边，通过简单地从水中提取盐来藐视法律。他说："我根本不知道违反盐法的行为将如何进行，"他说。"但它就像一道闪光，正如你所知道的，它足以把这个国家从一端震动到另一端。" </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The Salt March proved to be a stroke of genius, connecting the freedom struggle with the everyday experience of salt consumption that millions of poor people across the land could relate to. Gandhi took off from his ashram with seventy-eight followers and marched for several days to the oceanfront. He had astutely recruited ashram residents rather than political workers for the demonstration, since he recognized that it would call for strict adherence to the principles of satyagraha. Over the next few days, tens of thousands would greet the marchers along the way. Upon reaching the ocean, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, “With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 事实证明，"盐业游行 "是一个天才之举，它将自由斗争与全国各地数以百万计的穷人所能感受到的日常食盐消费经历联系起来。甘地带着78名追随者从他的修行院出发，向海滨行进了几天。他精明地招募了修行院的居民，而不是政治工作者参加示威，因为他认识到这需要严格遵守萨蒂格拉哈的原则。在接下来的几天里，数以万计的人将沿途迎接游行者。到达海边时，甘地举起一块咸泥，宣布："用这个，我将撼动大英帝国的根基"。 </p></div>

The British government imprisoned over sixty thousand. One poignant instance of satyagraha involving twenty-five hundred marchers was described by a United Press correspondent: “The officers ordered [the protestors] to retreat but they continued to step forward. Suddenly… scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shod [long batons]. Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. The survivors, without breaking ranks, silently  and doggedly marched on until struck down. The raids and beatings continued for several days.” </p></div>

International and domestic pressure started to grow on the British government to end its imperial rule.  Time  magazine named Gandhi its Man of the Year. Gandhi’s equation of satyagraha was unfolding with near-mathematical precision. Even during the freedom struggle’s worst setbacks, he had refused to believe that the British were evil; instead, he had projected that once the suffering of the oppressed became more visible, sooner or later, the humanity that lay hidden deep within the British people would come shining through, and they would reform. It was several years before India gained her outer freedom, but Gandhi’s satyagrahis had already started to gain inner freedom by replacing bodily force—the tool of past revolutionaries—with soul force. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Most of the millions in India who followed Gandhi did not deeply study his philosophy. “I know that a whole people can adopt [nonviolence]… without understanding its philosophy,” Gandhi once wrote. “People generally do not understand the philosophy of all their acts.” The Core intuitively knows what the intellect can sometimes not comprehend. Over time, as Gandhi’s methods have been studied and replicated globally by other reformers, including Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders in the United States, it has become clear that the emancipation of India was not Gandhi’s final aim. He used India as a proof point to show humanity the hidden virtues that lie present in its Core. Attempting to assess Gandhi’s impact on the world, Albert Einstein wrote, “Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon the earth.” Stafford Cripps, a member of Britain’s War Cabinet who was sent by Churchill on a mission to win India’s cooperation during World War II, later observed about Gandhi, “I know of no other man of any time or indeed of recent history who so forcefully and convincingly demonstrated the power of spirit over material things.” Churchill had believed that “Man is spirit,” and his  emissary to India, Cripps, found the person whom he believed most exemplified this truth. </p></div>

He never proved the equations, leaving it to other mathematicians to determine if they were true or false. In one study of his final six hundred equations,  99 percent of them were proved, decades later, to be true. Ramanujan claimed that the equations were revealed to him in visions by a higher power. “An equation for me has no meaning,” he said, “unless it expresses a thought of God.” The number zero, he believed, represented absolute reality, and the number infinity represented the many manifestations of that reality. </p></div>

But this model of our brain doesn’t allow us to explain Rohan’s or Sammie’s mom’s experience. After all, they had no experience stored in their mental database that could have prompted their behavior. </p></div>

Is this what the poet Tennyson meant when he wrote, “[We] are external manifestations of the Eternal Creative Spirit, differentiated into particular individualized forms”?

<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In 1943, the psychologist Abraham Maslow proposed that people’s motivations were governed by a hierarchy of needs. At the bottom lie our basic hungers for food and shelter. In the middle lie our needs for security and love. And at the very top lies self-actualization, the desire to pursue one’s full potential in a field of one’s own choosing. But that was not all. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 1943年，心理学家亚伯拉罕-马斯洛提出，人们的动机受需求层次的支配。底层是我们对食物和住所的基本渴求。中间是我们对安全和爱的需求。在最上面的是自我实现，即在自己选择的领域中追求自己的全部潜力的愿望。但这还不是全部。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> In his later years, Maslow revised his pyramid by adding another stage beyond self-actualization. He called it self-transcendence. “Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, [relating] to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the cosmos,” he wrote. “Practically every serious description of the ‘authentic person’ implies that such a person, by virtue of what he has become, assumes a new relation to his society and indeed, to society in general. He not only transcends himself in various ways; he also transcends his own culture.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 在他的晚年，马斯洛修订了他的金字塔，在自我实现之外增加了另一个阶段。他称其为自我超越。"他写道："超越是指人类意识的最高和最包容或整体的水平，[与]自己、重要的他人、一般的人类、其他物种、自然和宇宙有关。他写道："实际上，对'真正的人'的每一个严肃的描述都意味着，这样一个人，由于他所成为的东西，承担了与他的社会乃至整个社会的一种新关系。他不仅以各种方式超越了自己；他还超越了自己的文化"。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> The longing for transcendence, for a feeling of being connected to something much greater than yourself, is the highest of human hungers. Maslow investigated transcendence from the outside, interviewing people and formulating his ideas. But a tribe of truth-seekers has for thousands of years sought to cultivate transcendence from the inside, as a state to attain within themselves. These are the mystics, emerging out of a diversity of faiths and traditions, and united by  their hunger to discover and connect with the potentialities that lie dormant within us all. They may trek different paths to ascend to the mountaintop of human potential, but all mystics follow similar principles to guide their view of life and its true purpose. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 对超越的渴望，对与比自己更伟大的事物相联系的感觉的渴望，是人类最高的渴求。马斯洛从外部调查了超越性，采访了人们并形成了他的想法。但几千年来，有一个寻求真理的部落一直在寻求从内部培养超越性，作为一种在他们自己内部达到的状态。这些人就是神秘主义者，他们从不同的信仰和传统中涌现出来，并通过 ，他们渴望发现并与我们所有人体内沉睡的潜力联系在一起。他们可能会踏上不同的道路，登上人类潜能的山顶，但所有神秘主义者都遵循类似的原则，指导他们的人生观和真正目的。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> 1.   There is a force behind the universe; call it the Universal Core or what you may. This force is omnipresent (present everywhere), omniscient (knows everything), omnipotent (all-powerful), and all-loving. All human beings—and in fact, all life-forms—are individualized expressions of this Universal Core. </p></div>

</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> 2.   The purpose of life is to advance our consciousness so it can dissolve into the Universal Core. Higher consciousness isn’t a reward to be earned in an afterlife for having lived virtuously, but a state to cultivate here and now, in this life, through the instrumentalities of our body and mind, with the right techniques and ways of living. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 2.   生命的目的是提高我们的意识，使其能够溶入宇宙核心。更高的意识并不是在来世为有德行的人赢得的奖励，而是在此刻，在今生，通过我们身体和心灵的工具，用正确的技术和生活方式来培养的一种状态。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> 3.   Our Inner Core, or soul, is our true, perfect nature, a pure reflection of the Universal Core from which we have emerged. When we awaken to qualities of spirit such as peace, wisdom, love, and joy, we transcend our individual self to feel a sense of unity with all life and all creation. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 3.   我们的内在核心，或灵魂，是我们真正的、完美的本性，是宇宙核心的纯粹反映，我们就是从这个核心中产生出来的。当我们觉醒于精神的品质，如和平、智慧、爱和快乐，我们就会超越个人的自我，感受到与所有生命和所有创造物的统一性。 </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> 4.   When we serve other people and other forms of life, it is the spirit in us serving the spirit in them. In those moments, we are serving our higher self. Service to others is therefore life’s most natural calling. </p></div>

God is spirit, and when you or I reach our highest potential, we become one with spirit. “You are all gods if you only knew it,” said Yogananda. “Behind your waves of consciousness is the sea of God’s presence.” The Nobel Prize–winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger observed, “The mystics of many centuries, independently, yet in perfect harmony with each other (somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas) have described, each of them, the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase: DEUS FACTUS SUM (I have become God).” </p></div>

<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> Religions sometimes portray God in human terms, possessed of a gender, a physical form, and a voice, seated on a throne in a heavenly kingdom, experiencing human emotions like anger and pleasure. Humanizing this force is a way to make a profound mystery more approachable. If that is the starting point in our relationship with God, that is fine. But if it becomes the end point, the relationship can sour or become distorted, because a human form can disappoint us if we feel that it judges or punishes us or doesn’t care enough to intervene in our hour of need. Pure, loving spirit, in contrast, can never disappoint, for everything that happens to us is an invitation to come closer to our native land: cosmic consciousness. As Francis Bacon counseled in the quote at the start of this chapter, we need to expand our minds to take in the mystery, not contract the mystery to fit our minds. Mystics may bring the ineffable spirit down to a human level now and then, but they mostly strive to uplift their consciousness to a divine level. As the Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin  observed, “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 宗教有时会用人类的方式来描绘上帝，他拥有性别、身体形态和声音，坐在天国的宝座上，体验着人类的情感，如愤怒和快乐。将这种力量人性化是一种使深奥的奥秘更容易接近的方式。如果这是我们与上帝关系的起点，那很好。但如果它成为终点，这种关系就会变质或扭曲，因为如果我们觉得它审判或惩罚我们，或在我们需要的时候不够关心，那么人类的形式就会让我们失望。相比之下，纯洁的、充满爱的精神永远不会让人失望，因为发生在我们身上的每一件事都是一个邀请，让我们更接近我们的故乡：宇宙的意识。正如弗朗西斯-培根在本章开头的那段话中所建议的那样，我们需要扩大我们的思想来接受神秘，而不是收缩神秘来适应我们的思想。神秘主义者可能偶尔会把不可言喻的精神降到人类的水平，但他们大多努力把自己的意识提升到神圣的水平。 正如耶稣会教士皮埃尔-泰尔哈德-夏尔丹（Pierre Teilhard de Chardin）所说："我们不是有精神体验的人类。我们是拥有人类经验的精神生命。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The founding father of modern psychology, William James, took a deep interest in mysticism. In his book  The Varieties of Religious Experiences , he wrote, “There are two lives, the natural and the spiritual, and we must lose the one before we can participate in the other.… In mystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness.… The overcoming of all the usual barriers between the individual and the Absolute is the great mystic achievement.” </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 现代心理学的奠基人威廉-詹姆斯对神秘主义产生了浓厚的兴趣。他在 《宗教经历的多样性 》一书中写道："有两种生活，自然的和精神的，我们必须先失去一种生活，才能参与另一种生活....，在神秘状态下，我们都与绝对者合二为一，我们意识到我们的一体性....，克服个人与绝对者之间所有通常的障碍是神秘主义的伟大成就。" </p></div>
</div>
<div class ="bottom">
<div class ="top left">
<p class ="en"> William James’s appreciation of mystic states stands in sharp contrast to the views of Sigmund Freud. Freud was dismissive of mystical experiences, suggesting that “the longing for spiritual union, which mystics so universally express, is really an unconscious desire to escape a harsh, disappointing reality by returning to the world of blissful unity and completeness we knew when we were babies.” Despite his misconception of mysticism, Freud did direct us to an important part of our mind that lies beyond conscious awareness: the subconscious. Mystics direct us to another important part of our mind, one which also lies beyond conscious awareness but is very different from the subconscious: the  super conscious. </p></div>
<div class="top right">
<p class ="cn"> 威廉-詹姆斯对神秘主义状态的赞赏与西格蒙德-弗洛伊德的观点形成了鲜明的对比。弗洛伊德对神秘主义体验不屑一顾，认为 "神秘主义者普遍表达的对精神结合的渴望，实际上是一种无意识的欲望，通过回到我们还是婴儿时就知道的幸福统一和完整的世界，来逃避残酷的、令人失望的现实"。尽管弗洛伊德对神秘主义有误解，但他确实把我们引向了我们心灵中超越意识的一个重要部分：潜意识。神秘主义者将我们引向心灵的另一个重要部分，这个部分也在意识之外，但与潜意识非常不同： 超意识 。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Neuroscientist Andrew Newberg, a leading researcher in the emerging science of transcendence and mysticism, summed this up well in his book  Why God Won’t Go Away: Brain Science and the Biology of Belief . He points out that in the past, most scientists and psychologists regarded mystics as “the victims of damaged and deluded minds,” but they are now recognizing that mystical experiences are radically different from schizophrenia and other psychotic states. Mystics describe their experiences as joyful; psychotics are often frightened and distressed by their hallucinations. Mystical states involve “a loss of pride and ego, a quieting of the mind, and an emptying of the self”; psychotics “often have feelings of religious  grandiosity and inflated egotistical importance.” Mystics can choose to withdraw from social engagement for a period of time and then return to function normally; psychotics’ withdrawal is less voluntary and often long-lasting. People who experience mystical states have been found to “enjoy much higher levels of psychological health than the public at large, in terms of better interpersonal relationships, higher self-esteem, lower levels of anxiety, clearer self-identity, an increased concern for others, and a more positive overall outlook in life.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 神经科学家安德鲁-纽伯格（Andrew Newberg）是新兴的超越性和神秘主义科学的主要研究者，他在《 为什么上帝不会消失 》一书中对此进行了很好的总结 。脑科学和信仰的生物学 。他指出，在过去，大多数科学家和心理学家将神秘主义者视为 "受损和受骗心态的受害者"，但他们现在认识到，神秘主义体验与精神分裂症和其他精神病状态有着本质的区别。神秘主义者将他们的经历描述为快乐的；而精神病患者往往被他们的幻觉吓坏了，并感到痛苦。神秘状态涉及 "骄傲和自我的丧失，心灵的安静，以及自我的放空"；精神病患者 "经常有宗教 、宏大的感觉和膨胀的自我重要性"。神秘主义者可以选择在一段时间内退出社会活动，然后恢复正常功能；精神病患者的退出不那么自愿，而且往往是长期的。经历过神秘状态的人被发现 "享有比一般人高得多的心理健康水平，表现在更好的人际关系、更高的自尊、更低的焦虑水平、更清晰的自我认同、对他人更多的关注以及更积极的整体人生观。" </p></div>

This is when our subjects are most likely to describe incredible shifts of perception and experiences of unity consciousness… [which give] you the sense that “you” are dissolving and becoming one with everything else in the world, even God.… When your frontal lobe activity drops suddenly and significantly, logic and reason shut down. Everyday consciousness is suspended, allowing other brain centers to experience the world in intuitive and creative ways.… Our Buddhist subjects described the sensation as becoming one with pure consciousness.

These are two entirely different practices, but the unity experience affected the same areas in everyone’s brains. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> On an African safari in Botswana a few years ago, my spirit danced with joy each time we encountered wildlife—zebras, giraffes, lions, elephants, rhinos, and more. But every now and then we would  drive through barren terrain littered with mounds of mud. In those moments, I urged our guide John to keep moving to look for more interesting places. Then one time, I decided to inquire about the mounds. “Ah, I was wondering if you’d ask,” John said conspiratorially, as if he’d been holding on to a secret that was now ripe for sharing. “These are termite mounds.” He stopped our jeep next to one of them and continued, “Let me tell you some things about them.” What followed was a revelation. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> I learned that millions of termites contribute to making a mound, which is among the largest structures built by  any  animal. After hearing my guide’s introduction to the subject, I discovered Amia Srinivasan’s wonderful article “What Termites Can Teach Us,” in which she describes how a mound’s interior is “an intricate structure of interweaving tunnels and passageways, radiating chambers, galleries, archways, and spiral staircases.… It is not so much a building as a body, a self-regulating organic process that continuously reacts to its changing environment, building and unbuilding itself.… Termites appear to do all this without any centralized planning: there are no architects, engineers, or blueprints.… [While] individual termites are not particularly intelligent, lacking memory and the ability to learn… put enough termites together, in the right conditions, and they will build you a cathedral.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Einstein’s words came to my mind that day in Botswana: “There are two kinds of people. Those who believe everything is a miracle, and those who believe nothing is a miracle.” As I listened to the guide I felt as though Einstein were directly admonishing me. “Hitendra, if you had brought just a bit of curiosity to what you saw as dull, dead mounds, they would have left you awestruck, for they are shrines to nature’s genius.” I remembered how, as a child, I used to lie on our home lawn at night and look up at the sky in wonderment, trying to fathom the vast reach of the universe, feeling a kinship with every star I set my eyes on. And now here I was, feeling the same wonderment looking down at the ground I was standing on. “The real voyage of discovery,” Marcel Proust said, “consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 在博茨瓦纳的那一天，爱因斯坦的话出现在我的脑海中。"有两种人。一种是相信一切是奇迹的人，另一种是相信什么都不是奇迹的人"。当我听着导游的话时，我觉得爱因斯坦好像在直接告诫我。"希滕德拉，如果你对你所看到的枯燥无味的死土堆只带一点好奇心，它们会让你感到震惊，因为它们是大自然天才的圣地。"我记得小时候，我经常在晚上躺在家里的草坪上，惊奇地仰望天空，试图理解宇宙的广袤，觉得自己与每一颗星星都有亲情。而现在，我在这里，看着我所站的地面，感到同样的惊奇。"真正的发现之旅，"马塞尔-普鲁斯特说，"不在于寻找新的风景，而在于拥有新的眼睛。" </p></div>

Mother Teresa described herself as a little pencil in God’s hands: “God is writing his love letter to the world in this way, through works of love.… The essential thing is not what we say but what God says to us and through us.” Lincoln described himself as an “instrument” of a larger power, charged with “so vast, so sacred a trust.” Gandhi was once asked by an American journalist, Vincent Sheean, why he felt so certain when the inner voice spoke to him. “Others,” said Sheean, “have inner voices and are not sure.” He asked, “Does the certainty precede the [surrender]?” In other words, did Gandhi surrender to its guidance only once he was sure it was the voice of God? Gandhi replied, “No, the [surrender] precedes the certainty.” Sheean reports that “the words were said with vivacity, as if I had misunderstood something vital.” Gandhi was telling Sheean that it was only when he had “reduce[d] myself to a zero” by surrendering his own desires that he could be certain that the inner guidance he was receiving was not a projection of his ego, but of spirit. Great leaders are great followers. They strive to surrender their own attachments and hungers so they can gain guidance from the universe through their inner voice. </p></div>

Gandhi had been wrapped up in a long meeting, and when it ended he was told that two other Indian leaders had come to meet him. Conscious that he was late for his public prayer service, he told Manu, “Tell them that, if I remain alive, they can talk to me after the prayer on my walk.” Gandhi went out to greet the public and make his way to his seat; a few seconds later, he was dead, felled by an assassin’s bullet. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Growing up, Tom had a hot temper. One day when he was nineteen, while driving his pickup truck he almost ran into a man crossing the street.

<p class ="en"> Fifteen years later, Tom had propped his pickup truck on jacks and was underneath the vehicle working on it when the asphalt under one of the jacks gave way, causing the truck to fall onto Tom and crush him. Unable to breathe, Tom lost consciousness. He ultimately survived and later described what had happened while he was unconscious. His whole life flashed in front of him—every feeling, every thought, every word, every action. Greyson quotes him as saying, “My life review was absolutely, positively, everything basically from the first breath of life right through the accident. It was that panoramic view. It was everything.” Among the many incidents he reexperienced was the fight with the man he had attacked so brutally years before. Survivors of NDEs commonly report life reviews. As they near death, they stand witness to their whole life, including all the parts they had forgotten. Every detail. </p></div>

They are experiencing the embodiment of the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.” They realize that, as  Greyson says, this rule is not “a moral guideline we should strive to follow, but a description of how the world works, a law of nature as inescapable as gravity.” </p></div>

Experiencers tend to see themselves as integral parts of a benevolent and purposeful universe, in which personal gain, particularly at someone else’s expense, is no longer relevant.… Among the experiencers I’ve studied, 90 percent said their attitudes and beliefs changed as a result of their NDEs, and more than half said that the effects of their NDEs continued to increase over time. Two-thirds said they felt better about themselves as a result of their NDEs.

They lose their ambition to achieve by ordinary criteria for a successful life. Instead they may be very interested in helping others. [They start] to live more fully in the present moment, rather than dwell in the past or dream of the future.” </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Most experiencers, reports Dr. Greyson, even those without a particular religious faith, say that since their NDEs “they’ve been aware of the presence in their lives of  something  sacred or divine.” He goes on to report that “more than four out of five described having a  stronger belief in a higher power and an inner sense of divine presence” in which “they consistently describe feeling peaceful, calm, tranquil, ‘at home,’ grateful, and, most of all, loved.” Further, he writes, “Many experiencers use the analogy of a wave in the ocean to describe this condition. The wave is one small part of the vast ocean and is composed of the same water as the rest of the ocean, yet it maintains its integrity as a distinct wave with its own properties—at least for a while.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 格雷森博士报告说，大多数体验者，甚至那些没有特定宗教信仰的人，都说自从他们的无神论以来，"他们已经意识到他们的生活中存在着 一些 神圣的 东西 或神性"。他继续报告说，"超过五分之四的人描述了对更高力量的信仰和神圣存在的内在感觉， "，其中 "他们一直描述感觉到和平、平静、安宁、'在家'、感激，以及最重要的是，被爱。"此外，他写道："许多体验者用海洋中的波浪来比喻这种状况。波浪是浩瀚海洋中的一小部分，与海洋的其他部分由相同的水组成，但它作为一个独特的波浪，保持着自己的完整性，有自己的属性--至少在一段时间内。 </p></div>

<p class ="en"> That makes sense. But there is another truth to these words. When you operate from your authentic self, you start to see how much purity, beauty, and grace exist unconditionally within you, and you are naturally led to ponder, “If this is what exists within me, despite my foibles and failings, then it must exist within every human  being.” You begin to recognize others not simply for who they show up as on the outside, but for who they are at their Core. You strive to draw out the best in them, thus helping them come closer to their true self. As Goethe said, “The way you see people is the way you treat them, and the way you treat them is what they become.” </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 这很有道理。但这些话还有另一个真理。当你从真实的自我出发，你开始看到有多少纯洁、美丽和优雅无条件地存在于你的内心，你自然会思考："如果这是存在于我内心的东西，尽管我有缺点和失败，那么它一定存在于每个人的内心 。"你开始认识别人，不只是因为他们在外面的表现，而是因为他们的核心是什么。你努力引出他们最好的一面，从而帮助他们更接近真实的自我。正如歌德所说："你看人的方式就是你对待他们的方式，而你对待他们的方式就是他们成为的样子。 </p></div>

You will have transcended your human identity to experience the kind of state Tom did during his near-death experience: seeing yourself in everyone you encounter. Humanity, then, will be experienced by you as your own higher self; you will find the same spirit flowing through us all. You will only be true to yourself when you are true to all of humanity. This is the way of the mystic. ii </p></div>

<p class ="cn"> 而莎士比亚的话还有一个更深的道理。当你达到你的内在核心时，你就已经到达了支撑创造的宇宙核心。你将超越你的人类身份，体验到汤姆在濒死体验中的那种状态：在你遇到的每个人身上看到自己。那么，人类将被你体验为你自己更高的自我；你将发现同样的精神在我们所有人身上流动。只有当你忠于全人类的时候，你才会忠于自己。这就是神秘主义者的方式。 ii </p></div>

<p class ="en"> The encouragement and support I received from Kamel Jedidi, Joel Brockner, and Nayla Bahri were pivotal in getting my work on Personal Leadership off the ground. The Marketing Division at Columbia graciously gave me license to indulge in this newfound passion back in 2007. Dean Glenn Hubbard and his office took a big leap by agreeing to partly sponsor an MBA Personal Leadership retreat, which became a pivotal part of the class experience. Columbia’s MBA Academic Affairs team, Kelley Blanco and her EMBA team, Troy Eggers, Mike Malefakis, Pierre Yared, and their team at CBS Executive Education, and the business school team at Hong Kong University have been a joy to work with. Paul Ingram, Todd Jick, and Bruce Craven have given me great encouragement and insights at every stage of my Personal Leadership work at   Columbia. I also received much warmth and support for my work from Kathy Phillips, who tragically left the stage of life at the peak of her life and career, just before the seeds of collaboration we had sown could sprout. I am grateful as well for the early support I received from Michael Morris and Casey Ichniowski. </p></div>

<p class ="en"> Twelve years ago, David Burns allowed me to walk up to him at one of his seminars through a throng of his psychotherapist fans to introduce myself and explore a way to bridge his work into the business world. Since then, he’s become a valued counselor, a source of inspiration, and a treasured friend. I have learned so much from David about our emotions, thoughts, beliefs, words, and how they impact our happiness and our relationships. Dan Siegel’s passion for the human condition, and for integrating multiple streams of insight and inspiration to advance our understanding on this topic, had a formative influence on my early work in this area. But it is also the care and presence that he and Caroline Welch bring to all their interactions that have deeply moved and instructed me. Both through how they think and how they lead, Raghu Krishnamurthy and Rahul Varma have solidified my conviction about how central inner mastery is to success in executive roles. Carol Dweck was an early cheerleader as I sought to bring the latest psychological findings into the business school classroom fifteen years ago. I will forever cherish the kindness and grace with which she welcomed me at Stanford and offered thought partnership in the early, exploratory, somewhat fragile years of my forays into Personal Leadership. Dorian Ralston and Hara Marano took an early bet on me by researching my path to Personal Leadership and sharing it with the world through a cover story in   Psychology Today . Arthur Brooks has helped me in many formal and informal ways to find my place in the world as a writer; one of life’s special gifts is when you can see someone you deeply admire and look up to as your friend, and that’s what Arthur is to me. </p></div>

Natasha Gill, Simran Bhui, Cara Fernandes, and more recently Anushka Mimani conducted some of the biographical and autobiographical research on inspiring leaders, found source material, and provided invaluable feedback on early drafts of book chapters. Andrea Miller and Jerry Foulkes have, over the years, offered much wisdom and encouragement on moving my work from the classroom to the camera, and now to a book. Achala Punja researched   and wrote ten beautiful essays on iconic leaders that helped me form my own thinking on these luminous lives. Preeti Srinivasan became a valued research associate and thought partner in my early days of writing, and, over time, a dear friend. Sabina Beri provided such warm-spirited and selfless support in guiding my early thinking on the path to publishing. Pam Krauss has been a treasured guide through the topsy-turvy ride down the publishing lane. Lauren Landress was especially helpful in helping me link my mental library of   Yogananda’s words with published sources. Eleanor Campbell provided me a much-valued opportunity to learn how this book might be experienced by today’s college-going youth, and to chip away at a few rough edges in my writing before it was too late. Brad Stulberg, Austin Smith, and other kindred spirits have given me great counsel on how to prepare myself for a book launch. </p></div>

Dan Burrier gave me rich inputs on an early draft of the manuscript and brought a brand marketer’s eye to polishing my ideas and phrasings of things. He’s been a constant, caring, and committed presence in the unfoldment of my work over many years. Jan Petrie has been a treasured spiritual sister and guide from the day I first met her, and I have benefited so much from her perspectives in the writing of this book.
